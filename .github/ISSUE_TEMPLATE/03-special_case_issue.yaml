        If your issue doesn't neatly fit into either the bug report or feature request categories, and it involves a more complex or unique scenario, use this template.

        * [Feature Request Template](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/new?template=2-feature_request.yaml)

        If the required information is not provided upon request, the issue may be closed.
