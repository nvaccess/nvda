        ### Troubleshooting steps

        The following questions ask about the basic investigation steps you may have completed.
        Please feel free to add more information here to tell us about what you have tried.

  - type: dropdown
    id: restart
    validations:
      required: true
    attributes:
      label: Does the issue still occur after restarting your computer?
      description: |
        Restarting your computer will help to ensure that software is in a fresh state.
      options: [
        "I have restarted my computer and the issue still occurs",
        "Restarting my computer fixes the issue temporarily, but it comes back later",
        "Restarting my computer fixed the issue",
        "I have not restarted my computer",
      ]

  - type: dropdown
    id: addons
    validations:
      required: true
    attributes:
      label: If NVDA add-ons are disabled, is your problem still occurring?
      description: |
        In many cases issues could be caused by an add-on not working correctly or conflicting with other features already integrated in NVDA itself.
        Therefore, it is recommended to reproduce issues with all add-ons disabled.
        You can restart NVDA with add-ons disabled through the exit dialog.
        In case the issue is caused by an add-on, it is recommended to contact the author of the add-on first.
      options: [
        "I have restarted NVDA with add-ons disabled and the issue still occurs",
        "I have restarted NVDA with add-ons disabled and the issue no longer occurs",
        "I have not restarted NVDA with add-ons disabled",
      ]

  - type: dropdown
    id: comRegFix
    validations:
      required: true
    attributes:
      label: Does the issue still occur after you run the COM Registration Fixing Tool in NVDA's tools menu?
      description: |
        COM DLL files, which the IAccessible COM interface depends on, can get unregistered after installing and uninstalling different programs on a computer.
        The consequence is that NVDA in certain cases does not work properly.
        Specifically, it reports "unknown" when trying to navigate websites or fails to switch between focus and browse mode, it causes performance issues, focus instability and other odd problems.
        The COM registry fixing tool has been introduced in order to re-register those DLL files.
        In any case, re-registering those DLL files does not have any negative impact on a computer's functionality.
        Note that when installing NVDA, this tool is ran automatically.
        Thus, it is recommended to run the fixing tool whenever focus problems, performance problems on websites or navigation problems in focus or browse mode on different interfaces are encountered.
      options: [
        "I have run the COM Registration Fixing Tool and the issue still occurs",
        "I have run the COM Registration Fixing Tool and the issue no longer occurs",
        "I have not run the COM Registration Fixing Tool",
      ]
