The following Braille displays are supported:
- BRAILLEX EL 40c, EL 80c, EL 20c, EL 60c (USB)
- BRAILLEX EL 40s, EL 80s, EL 2d80s, EL 70s, EL 66s (USB)
- BRAILLEX Trio (USB and bluetooth)
- BRAILLEX Live 20, BRAILLEX Live and BRAILLEX Live Plus (USB and bluetooth)
-

These displays do not support NVDA's automatic background braille display detection functionality.
There is an option in the display's USB driver which can cause an issue with loading the display.
Please try the following:
+ Please make sure that you have installed the [latest driver](https://www.papenmeier-rehatechnik.de/en/service/downloadcenter/software/articles/software-braille-devices.html).
+ Open the Windows Device Manager.
+ Scroll down the list to "USB Controllers" or "USB Devices".
+ Select "Papenmeier Braillex USB Device".
+ Open the properties and switch to the "Advanced" tab.
Sometimes the "Advanced" tab doesn't appear.
If this is the case, disconnect the braille display from the computer, exit NVDA, wait a moment and reconnect the braille display.
Repeat this 4 to 5 times if necessary.
If the "Advanced" tab is still not displayed, please restart the computer.
+ Disable the "Load VCP" option.
+

Most devices have an Easy Access Bar (EAB) that allows intuitive and fast operation.
The EAB can be moved in four directions where generally each direction has two switches.
The C and Live series are the only exceptions to this rule.

The c-series and some other displays have two routing rows whereby the upper row is used to report formatting information.
Holding one of the upper routing keys and pressing the EAB on c-series devices emulates the second switch state.
The live series displays have one routing row only and the EAB has one step per direction.
The second step may be emulated by pressing one of the routing keys and pressing the EAB in the corresponding direction.
Pressing and holding the up, down, right and left keys (or EAB) causes the corresponding action to be repeated.

Generally, the following keys are available on these braille displays:
|| Name | Key |
| l1 | Left front key |
| l2 | Left rear key |
| r1 | Right front key |
| r2 | Right rear key |
| up | 1 Step up |
| up2 | 2 Steps up |
| left | 1 Step left |
| left2 | 2 Steps left |
| right | 1 Step right |
| right2 | 2 Steps right |
| dn | 1 Step down |
