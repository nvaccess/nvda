"""Maps names of the executables to the names of the appModule which should be loaded for the given program.
Note that this map is used only for appModules included in NVDA
and appModules registered by add-ons are placed in a different one.
This mapping is needed since:
- Names of some programs are incompatible with the Python's import system (they contain a dot or a plus)
- Sometimes it is necessary to map one module to multiple executables - this map saves us from adding multiple
 appModules in such cases.
