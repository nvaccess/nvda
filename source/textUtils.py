class WideStringOffsetConverter:
	R"""
	Object that holds a string in both its decoded and its UTF-16 encoded form.
	The object allows for easy conversion between offsets in str type strings,
	and offsets in wide character (UTF-16) strings (that are aware of surrogate characters).
	This representation is used by all wide character strings in Windows (i.e. with characters of type L{ctypes.c_wchar}).

	In Python 3 strings, every offset in a string corresponds with one unicode codepoint.
	In UTF-16 encoded strings, 32-bit unicode characters (such as emoji)
	are encoded as one high surrogate and one low surrogate character.
	Therefore, they take not one, but two offsets in such a string.
	This behavior is equivalent to how Python 2 unicode strings behave,
	which are internally encoded as UTF-16.

	For example: ðŸ˜‚ takes one offset in a Python 3 string.
	However, in a Python 2 string or UTF-16 encoded wide string,
	this character internally consists of two characters: \ud83d and \ude02.
