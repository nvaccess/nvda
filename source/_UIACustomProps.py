"""
This module provides helpers and a common format to define UIA custom properties.
The common custom properties are defined here.
Custom properties specific to an application should be defined within a NVDAObjects/UIA
submodule specific to that application, E.G. 'NVDAObjects/UIA/excel.py'

UIA originally had hard coded 'static' ID's for properties.
For an example see 'UIA_SelectionPatternId' in
`source/comInterfaces/_944DE083_8FB8_45CF_BCB7_C477ACB2F897_0_1_0.py`
imported via `UIAutomationClient.py`.
When a new property was added the UIA spec had to be updated.
Now a mechanism is in place to allow applications to register "custom properties".
This relies on both the UIA server application and the UIA client application sharing a known
GUID for the property.
