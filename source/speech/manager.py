class SpeechManager(object):
	"""Manages queuing of speech utterances, calling callbacks at desired points in the speech, profile switching, prioritization, etc.
	This is intended for internal use only.
	It is used by higher level functions such as L{speak}.

	The high level flow of control is as follows:
	1. A speech sequence is queued with L{speak}, which in turn calls L{_queueSpeechSequence}.
	2. L{_processSpeechSequence} is called to normalize, process and split the input sequence.
		It converts callbacks to indexes.
		All indexing is assigned and managed by this class.
		It maps any indexes to their corresponding callbacks.
		It splits the sequence at indexes so we easily know what has completed speaking.
		If there are end utterance commands, the sequence is split at that point.
		We ensure there is an index at the end of all utterances so we know when they've finished speaking.
		We ensure any config profile trigger commands are preceded by an utterance end.
		Parameter changes are re-applied after utterance breaks.
		We ensure any entered profile triggers are exited at the very end.
	3. L{_queueSpeechSequence} places these processed sequences in the queue
		for the priority specified by the caller in step 1.
		There is a separate queue for each priority.
	4. L{_pushNextSpeech} is called to begin pushing speech.
		It looks for the highest priority queue with pending speech.
		Because there's no other speech queued, that'll be the queue we just touched.
	5. If the input begins with a profile switch, it is applied immediately.
	6. L{_buildNextUtterance} is called to build a full utterance and it is sent to the synth.
	7. For every index reached, L{_handleIndex} is called.
		The completed sequence is removed from L{_pendingSequences}.
		If there is an associated callback, it is run.
		If the index marks the end of an utterance, L{_pushNextSpeech} is called to push more speech.
	8. If there is another utterance before a profile switch, it is built and sent as per steps 6 and 7.
	9. In L{_pushNextSpeech}, if a profile switch is next, we wait for the synth to finish speaking before pushing more.
		This is because we don't want to start speaking too early with a different synth.
		L{_handleDoneSpeaking} is called when the synth finishes speaking.
		It pushes more speech, which includes applying the profile switch.
	10. The flow then repeats from step 6 onwards until there are no more pending sequences.
	11. If another sequence is queued via L{speak} during speech,
		it is processed and queued as per steps 2 and 3.
	12. If this is the first utterance at priority now, speech is interrupted
		and L{_pushNextSpeech} is called.
		Otherwise, L{_pushNextSpeech} is called when the current utterance completes
		as per step 7.
	13. When L{_pushNextSpeech} is next called, it looks for the highest priority queue with pending speech.
		If that priority is different to the priority of the utterance just spoken,
		any relevant profile switches are applied to restore the state for this queue.
	14. If a lower priority utterance was interrupted in the middle,
		L{_buildNextUtterance} applies any parameter changes that applied before the interruption.
	15. The flow then repeats from step 6 onwards until there are no more pending sequences.

	Note:
	All of this activity is (and must be) synchronized and serialized on the main thread.
