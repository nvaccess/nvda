	Add-on authors are recommended not to depend on values and use a `State` directly.
	From a string, this can be done as `controlTypes.State[nameOfState]` e.g. `State["CHECKED"]`.
	Although unlikely to change, if names/values changing represents a significant risk for your add-on,
	then consider decoupling, and maintain an internal mapping of `State` to add-on internal states.

	As add-on authors may still rely on the values, new members of State should continue
	the pattern of incrementing.
