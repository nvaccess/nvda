"""
This module contains localizable version information such as description, copyright and About messages etc.
As there are localizable strings at module level, this can only be imported once localization is set up via languageHandler.initialize.
To access version information for programmatic version checks before languageHandler.initialize, use the buildVersion module which contains all the non-localizable version information such as major and minor version, and version string etc.
