	`gui.message.messageBox` is a function which blocks the calling thread,

	When some action (e.g. quitting NVDA) should be prevented due to any active modal message box,
	even if unrelated, use `isModalMessageBoxActive` to check before triggering the action.
	NVDA is in an uncertain state while waiting for an answer from a `gui.message.messageBox`.

	It's possible for multiple message boxes to be open at a time.
	This function can be used to check before opening subsequent `gui.message.messageBox` instances.

	Because an answer is required to continue after a modal messageBox is opened,
	some actions such as shutting down are prevented while NVDA is in a possibly uncertain state.
