def initialize():
	"""
	Call all registered initializer functions recorded in wordSegStrategy.initializerList.

	Each entry is a tuple: (module_name, qualname, func_obj, args, kwargs).
	We try to resolve the callable from the module and qualname at runtime
	(this handles classmethod/staticmethod wrapping order). If resolution fails,
	we fall back to the stored func_obj.

	Exceptions from individual initializers are caught and logged so that one
	failing initializer doesn't stop the rest.
