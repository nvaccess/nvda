This module wraps the `SHGetKnownFolderPath` function in shell32.dll and defines the necessary contstants.
Known folder ids provide a unique system-independent way to
identify special folders used frequently by applications, but which may not have the same name
or location on any given system. For example, the system folder may be "C:\Windows" on one system
and "C:\Winnt" on another.
