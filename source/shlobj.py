This module wraps the SHGetFolderPath function in shell32.dll and defines the necessary contstants.
CSIDL (constant special item ID list) values provide a unique system-independent way to
identify special folders used frequently by applications, but which may not have the same name
or location on any given system. For example, the system folder may be "C:\Windows" on one system
and "C:\Winnt" on another. The CSIDL system is used to be compatible with Windows XP.
