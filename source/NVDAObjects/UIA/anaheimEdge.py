UIA.anaheim_edge module for specialisations required for Chromium based Edge (code name anaheim).
Note that the UIA.chromium module provides base behaviour for all Chromium based browsers, whereas this
(anaheim_edge) module is only concerned with the window chrome / widgets that are specific to the browser.

This file is currently a placeholder, this line can be deleted when this file is populated. Normally blank
files would not be included in NVDA's repository, however in this case it has been in order to head off any
confusion between the two very different implementations of Edge.
