	file `name' when the context manager scope ends and the the context manager __exit__ is called. This
	means writing out the complete file can be performed with less concern of corrupting the original file
	if the process is interrupted by windows shutting down.

	Usage:
		with FaultTolerantFile("myFile.txt") as f:
			f.write("This is a test")

	This creates a temporary file, and the writes actually happen on this temp file. At the end of the 
	`with` block, when `f` goes out of context the temporary file is closed and, this temporary file replaces "myFile.txt"
