"""
This module provides helpers and a common format to define UIA custom annotation types.
The common custom annotation types are defined here.
Custom annotation types specific to an application should be defined within a NVDAObjects/UIA
submodule specific to that application, E.G. 'NVDAObjects/UIA/excel.py'

UIA originally had hard coded 'static' ID's for annotation types.
For an example see 'AnnotationType_SpellingError' in
`source/comInterfaces/_944DE083_8FB8_45CF_BCB7_C477ACB2F897_0_1_0.py`
imported via `UIAutomationClient.py`.
When a new annotation type was added the UIA spec had to be updated.
Now a mechanism is in place to allow applications to register "custom annotation types".
This relies on both the UIA server application and the UIA client application sharing a known
GUID for the annotation type.
