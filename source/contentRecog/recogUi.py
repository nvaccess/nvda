"""User interface for content recognition.
This module provides functionality to capture an image from the screen
for the current navigator object, pass it to a content recognizer for recognition
and present the result to the user so they can read it with cursor keys, etc.
NVDA scripts or GUI call the L{recognizeNavigatorObject} function with the recognizer they wish to use.
