	Create an empty temporary file and return its path.

	tempfile.mktemp is deprecated as creating a temp file in the system's temp directory is a security risk,
	without holding it open, as the file could be created by an attacker with the same name.
	mkstemp / NamedTemporaryFile was created for the purpose of creating temporary files securely.
	However, we do not need this secure behaviour,
	as we are just creating a temp file to move a file to for future deletion.
	As such, we close the file handle and return the path.
