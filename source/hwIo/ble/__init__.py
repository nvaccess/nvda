"""Raw I/O for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices

This module provides classes for scanning for BLE devices and communicating with them.
It uses the Bleak library for BLE communication.

Only use this if you need access to a device that only implements BLE and not Bluetooth Classic.
Bluetooth Classic devices should be paired through Windows' Bluetooth settings and accessed through the related serial/HID device.
