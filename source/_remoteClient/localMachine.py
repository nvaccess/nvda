"""Local machine interface for NVDA Remote.

This module provides functionality for controlling the local NVDA instance
in response to commands received from remote connections.

The main class :class:`LocalMachine` implements all local control operations
that can be triggered by remote NVDA instances. It includes safety features like
muting and uses wxPython's CallAfter for thread synchronization.

.. note::

	This module is part of the NVDA Remote protocol implementation and should
	not be used directly outside of the remote connection infrastructure.
