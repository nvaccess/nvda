"""Constants for Tivomatic Caiku Albatross 46 and 80 display driver.

Summary of important constants:

- L{INIT_STARTBYTE} and L{MAX_SETTINGS_BYTE}; when there is no connection,
the display continuously sends L{INIT_START_BYTE} followed by the settings byte.
The number of these packets is arbitrary. L{INIT_START_BYTE} is \xff.
Settings byte can be from \x00 to \xff.
It is limited to be at most L{MAX_SETTINGS_BYTE} to reliably detect init packets.

- L{ESTABLISHED}; driver sends this to confirm connection, and
display stops sending init packets

- all data to show on display has to be enclosed with L{START_BYTE} and
L{END_BYTE}

- L{BOTH_BYTES} is used to keep connection; display falls back to
"wait for connection state" if it does not get appropriate data packet
within approximately 2 seconds. L{KC_INTERVAL} defines suitable time which
in turn is used by timer.

- part of display buttons L{Keys} are control keys used to compose key
combinations. See also L{CONTROL_KEY_CODES}.

- L{LEFT_RIGHT_KEY_CODES} is used when handling custom key layouts.

- L{RESET_COUNT} defines how many times port buffer reset is done before
trying to establish connection.
There are many I/O buffers between device and driver so several
resets are done to ensure all buffers are cleared.
Buffers may contain unexpected packets possibly due to write operations
of other drivers with same PID&VID during automatic detection.
There are also arbitrary number of redundant normal init packets which
can be safely ignored.

MAX_SETTINGS_BYTE = b"\xfe"
"""Maximum value allowed for settings byte.
Settings byte can be anything from \x00 to \xff. However, \xff
would make connection establishment quite complex:

- cannot be sure if the first byte received is L{INIT_START_BYTE} or
settings byte
- if settings byte is not L{INIT_START_BYTE} it is easier
- similarly it is easy to detect if whole init packet is received,
it is possible that the second byte is received during next read operation
- typically there are tens of init packets but the number of packets
varies

Settings byte limitation causes maximum number of status cells to be 14
(with \xff 15) in 80 model. Limitation is applied only if other settings
would make settings byte to be \xff. These are very big values (5 could be
normal maximum value), and NVDA does not utilize status cells.

Although settings like number of status cells are adjusted in display
menu, display itself does not use them. They are just notes for screenreaders.
For example, display has no separate status cells. It is screenreader
or driver job to use them when applicable.

Only display settings which affects on its own functionality are baud rate
and key repeat which can be slow or fast.

There are other devices with same PID&VID. When automatic braille display
detection is used, other displays with same PID&VID are tried before Albatross.
Those drivers try to send queries to the port to detect their own displays.
These queries may cause Albatross to send unexpected init packets which in
turn could disturb this driver - it could get inappropriate settings byte.
This is tried to prevent by resetting I/O buffers so that strange packets
would be discarded.

If however, there are still strange init packets, Albatross should be
manually selected from the display list.
