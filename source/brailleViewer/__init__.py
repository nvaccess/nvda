"""
### Overview
This package contains the components for a "Braille Viewer". A window, that shows the braille dots that
would be displayed on a hardware device. The raw text for each cell is also shown.
This tool consists of:
- A GUI for the viewer.
- Construction / destruction / update helpers.

The current intention is to be able to support a physical braille device while using the "Braille Viewer".
Due to limitations in the design of brailleHandler, the number of cells in the "Braille Viewer" must match any
connected physical device.

### Life-cycle
- Constructing / showing the BrailleViewer
	- On startup via L{core.doStartupDialogs}
	- Via NVDA (tools) menu via L{Mainframe.onToggleSpeechViewerCommand}
- Hiding / destroying the BrailleViewer
	- On exit of NVDA.
	- Via NVDA (tools) menu via L{Mainframe.onToggleSpeechViewerCommand}
	- When the Window receives a close event. This means the GUI must be able to call-back to clean up
	BrailleHandler and the NVDA tools menu. This callback happens via the L{postBrailleViewerToolToggledAction}

### Number of cells shown
The default (40) is set in L{createBrailleViewerTool}.

### Routing
Currently not supported.
In order to support routing the user must be able to click on the cells. This means that the BrailleViewer
window gains focus, and the braille values are changed. To avoid this would require substantial changes to
brailleHandler.

### Scrolling
Scrolling is supported by binding a gesture to the braille_scroll_forward and braille scroll_back commands.
For the same reason that Routing is not supported, scrolling via button clicks on the braille viewer window
is not supported.
