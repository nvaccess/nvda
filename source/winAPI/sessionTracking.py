"""
Session tracking was introduced so that NVDA has a mechanism to track activation of the Windows lock screen.
This is required to support the privacy and data integrity of the logged in user.
NVDA restricts access to NVDA settings and certain tools while the system is locked,
and prevents navigating beyond apps open on the lock screen (LockScreen.exe, Magnifier, some notifications).

Used to:
- only allow a whitelist of safe scripts to run
- ensure object navigation cannot occur outside of the lockscreen
