/**
 * Obtain a user friendly name for a URL if possible.

 * For a URL which is not path-based (e.g. javascript), return the URL with the protocol (the portion before the colon) stripped.
 * For a path-based URL (e.g. http) or a URL with no protocol (which is assumed to be a path), modify the URL as follows:
 *  * Start with the last path component which is not empty.
 *  * If this is not the hostname and there is no trailing slash, which means we're probably dealing with a filename, strip the extension; i.e. everything after the last "." character.
 *  * Append the query string and the anchor target, if any, with the "#" and "?" characters replaced with spaces.
 * @param url: The URL.
 * @return: The user friendly name for the URL.
