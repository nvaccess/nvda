	Inputs:
	- SpeechManager.speak()
	- SpeechManager.cancel()
	- SpeechManager.removeCancelledSpeechCommands: Normally via eventHandler.executeEvent
	- SpeechManager._onSynthIndexReached(): Normally via synthDriverHandler.synthIndexReached extensionPoint
	- SpeechManager._onSynthDoneSpeaking(): Normally via synthDriverHandler.synthDoneSpeaking extensionPoint
	- queueHandler.pumpAll(): handles all pending _onSynthIndexReached and _onSynthDoneSpeaking calls.
	Outputs:
	- synthDriverHandler.getSynth().speak(): Send speech to the synth.
	- synthDriverHandler.getSynth().cancel(): Cancel current speech.
	- CallbackCommand: Converted into index commands. When the index is reached (by the synth) the callback is
			called after queueHandler.pumpAll is called.

	The expectation method should be used as a context manager to assert the pre/post conditions on interactions
