# E124 - Requires mixing spaces and tabs: Closing bracket does not match visual indentation.
# E125 - Does not take tabs into consideration: Continuation line with same indent as next logical line.
# E129 - Requires mixing spaces and tabs: Visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
# E131 - Requires mixing spaces and tabs: Continuation line unaligned for hanging indent
# E133 - Our preference handled by ET126: Closing bracket is missing indentation
