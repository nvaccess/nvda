# Manual testing

Commonly tested components of NVDA should have standard test plans.
Additionally, NVDA needs to be tested against various forms of hardware and applications.

This directory contains markdown files group by the NVDA component, e.g. "addon store", "start up / shutdown", "speech dictionaries", "settings", etc.

The goal is to document manual test plans for commonly tested NVDA components.
This gives contributors a base test plan when creating PRs that touch these NVDA components.
