## Manual testing

Commonly tested components of NVDA should have standard test plans.

This directory contains markdown files group by the NVDA component, e.g. "addon store", "start up / shutdown", "speech dictionaries", "settings", etc.

The goal is to document manual test plans for commonly tested NVDA components.
This gives contributors a base test plan when creating PRs that touch these NVDA components.
