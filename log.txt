    Avoid UIA event flooding in NvDA by  moving UIA event handler COM objects into c++ (#14888)
    
    If NVDA is flooded with UI Automation events, such as textChange events from Windows consoles, NVDA may seem to freeze, and or UIA focus tracking completely stops.
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA should remain responsive when being flooded with many UI Automation events, E.g. large amounts of text being written to a Windows console.
    Description of development approach
    Implement a new UI Automation event handler COM object in c++ which avoids calling into Python, and instead stores the events, and requests NvDA's main thread to later wake and read off the events when it can. This COM object also coalesces duplicate automation and propertyChange events for the same element, so that NVDA is no longer flooded with duplicate events, E.g. textChange events in Windows consoles.
    The path for a UI Automation event is now as follows:
    • In an MTA thread, the new c++ UIA event handler COM object receives the event via its handle*Event method from UI Automation core.
    • The event is stored in a list of events.
    • If the event type supports coalescing (automation and propertyChange events), An existing duplicate event is looked up in a map, and if one exists, the existing event is removed from the list, and the map entry is then pointed to the newest event.
    • If there was no existing event, a new entry is added to the map for this event.
    • In other words: the events are stored in the list in order they were received, but any duplicate events are removed, leaving only the latest ones. Ecentually an ordered dictionary.
    • If this event type does not support coalescing (E.g. focusChange event), NVDA is requested to wake and flush the event queue on its main thread as soon as it can.
    • If this event does support coalescing, and this is the first event since the last flush, then NVDA is requested to wake and flush the event queue in around 30 ms, giving time for more events to possibly be received and coalesced.
    • When NvDA wakes on its main thread, It requests the rate limited UIA event handler to flush its event list, emitting all the stored events out to our original Python UIA event handler COM object for normal handling.
    These changes mean that UIA core in the MTA is never blocked waiting for the Python GIL, and from its perspective, event handling is instantanious. Thus UIA core should never feel the need to kill off events, including focus change events.
    This pr also provides a couple of extra optimizations for UIA handling in Python:
    • UIAHandler events: avoid needlessly creating an NVDAObject when the event is for the focus object.
    • UIA event handlers: pass windowHandle into NvDAObject constructor if we already have it.

    Allow more batch actions in the add-on store (remove, enable and disable) (#15646)
    
    Closes #15623
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In the store, install action can be executed on multiple add-ons. Other batch actions are needed.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The following additional batch actions are now available in the store:
    
    Remove selected add-ons
    Update selected add-ons
    Enable selected add-ons
    Disable selected add-ons
    
    Description of development approach
    Use the same condition as the one required for the corresponding single action to occur.
    For code simplicity there is no distinction between Enable and Enable (override) for the corresponding multiple action. Anyway, when an add-on should override compatibility to be enabled, there is a confirmation dialog box.
    Also for simplicity, there is no multiple replace action:
    if a multiple selection contains installable add-on with or without updatable or replaceable add-ons, the "Install selected add-ons" batch action will be available
    If a multiple selection contains updatable add-ons, replaceable add-ons or both types, the "Update selected add-ons" batch action will be available.
    For batch actions requiring a confirmation (e.g. override incompatibility, uninstall), the confirmation dialog box has a "Remember this choice" checkbox so that the user can answer yes or no for all the same questions.
    When many add-ons are selected and a batch action is applied to them, the action actually applies only to the add-ons for which it is appropriate. E.g batch enable will not be applied to already enabled add-ons.

    Add an "on-demand" speech mode (#15804)
    
    Closes #481
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In some situations, e.g. meetings or when an alternative information channel (braille, visual with magnification), the user does not want NVDA to provide speech feedback on actions such as moving the cursor or focus. But they still want to have NVDA speaking on specific request.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Add a new speech "on demand" mode in the NVDA+S toggle command. When speech on demand is selected, NVDA does not provide a speech feedback for actions, but still speak on explicit request.
    
    The criterion to determine if a command should speak in "on demand" mode is:
    
    if the command is mainly to perform an action and the speech is only a feedback after this action, NVDA does not speak. Said otherwise, this command could have a usefulness when used blindly without any speech (or braille or visual) feedback
    if the goal command is mainly to provide information without performing any other action, NVDA speaks.
    Note: although say all commands move the cursor, they are speaking in the "on demand" mode since there is no point running them if speech is totally off.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added a new speech mode
    Added a new "speakOnDemand" parameter for the script decorator to indicate which script should speak in this mode.

    Again support WDAG in Microsoft Edge. (#15810)
    
    NVDA's support for Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) no longer workds as the requirement that the remote WDAG UIA tree be parented into the local tree under the main WDAG window is lon longer true. Thus it is impossible to find the local WDAG window and use this window handle for all WDAG NVDAObjects.
    This means that NVA is essentially silent while focus is within a WDAG applcation.
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA can again interact with applications such as Microsoft edge when run in Windows Defender Application Guard.
    Description of development approach
    • When trying to find the window handle for a WDAG UIA element, rather than walking up the ancestry, instead use the currently active window, if it is a WDAG host window and its for the same instance as the UIA element.
    • Improve and refactor the part of UIA NVDAObject's findOverlayClasses method that deals with Chrome objects, to match on a UIA framework of 'Chrome', not just of a particular Chrome window class. Code needed to be also reordered so that more specific cases such as documents and lists where looked for first, before the more generic Chrome UIA classes.

    Report unavailable (disabled) objects during object navigation (#15785)
    
    Closes #15477
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In a GUI, disabled (greyed) items are visible to sighted users. So unless there is a good reason, blind people should be able to see them too. Greyed items convey meaning in a GUI and not being able to see them causes people to miss information conveyed by the GUI.
    
    For example in the new audio panel, if you run NVDA from source (or probably portable), the audio ducking item is greyed out (disabled). Being allowed to find the disabled item informs the user that NVDA has an audio ducking options but that this options can not be enabled.
    
    Unfortunately, disabled controls are ignored during object navigation.
    
    This is also inconsistant with document review mode where disabled objects are not ignored.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    During object navigation (complete, simple or flattened), disabled object will not be ignored anymore.
    
    Description of development approach
    For presentation type, do not classify objects with state UNAVAILABLE to presType_unavailable.
    For windows isUsableWindow does not return False for windows that are not enabled

    bdDetect: Enrich USB serial data with info about USB device (#15764)
    
    Many braille displays use a serial converter from FTDI with VID 0x403" and PID 0x6001. Given the weird nature of Albatross devices not being able to identify themselves on request, the Albatross driver is currently a disturbing factor in automatic detection.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    This pr enriches information for serial ports in bdDetect. The _DeviceInfoFetcher class now has an extra autoprop usbComPorts that bundles com port info with USB metadata. If all works as expected, the Albatross driver will be able to limit itself to Albatross devices only after this pr by using the busReportedDeviceDescription dictionary entry.
    Removed duplicated code from hwPortUtils

    Mark add-on store code as public API (#15777)
    
    Initially, the majority of new add-on store code was marked as part of the private API. This was because it was an extremely large change and there were expected and unexpected changes to happen to the code in subsequent releases.
    
    The add-on store was introduced in 2023.2. By the time 2024.1 is released, we can expect the add-on store API to be relatively stable.

    Fix reporting of native Word commands to jump to table boundaries (#15809)
    
    Closes #15805
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In older versions of NVDA, NVDA was providing a speech feedback of the landing cell when using Word native commands for table navigation to jump to first or last cell of row or column: alt+home, alt+end, alt+pgUp and alt+pgDown. From NVDA 2023.2 onwards, this speech feedback is erroneous and reports the origin cell instead of the landing one. This is because the script for this commands was not robust and was taking advantage of existing delays in NVDA processing. in NVDA 2023.2 these delays have been reduced what uncovered this bug.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The landing cell will be reported correctly again when using native Word table navigation to jump to first or last cell of row or column.
    
    Description of development approach
    Strategy inspired from #14984: send the gesture and check if the cursor location has changed before reporting its new position. If the cursor does not move, e.g. because you call a command to jumpt to first cell while you are already on the first cell, the current cell is reported after a maximum delay set to 0.15 seconds (same value as some other polling scripts).

    Description of development approach
    Rather than the previous approach where we removed the listing of SysListView32 from the list of bad UIA class names, this adds a specific utility function to checks for a Framework Id of WinForm. If that's the case, we use UIA for SysListView32, as it seems these implementations are mature enough.

    Edge with UIA: allow activating  buttons in browse mode by walking ancestors until an action succeeds (#15748)
    
    Fixes #14612
    
    Summary of the issue:
    when accessing Microsoft Edge with UI Automation, NVDA is unable to activate most buttons and controls in browse mode.
    This is because NvDA only tries to invoke/select/toggle the deepest element at the browse mode caret position, which may be a text leaf, or span within the interactive control, and not the control itself.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Microsoft Edge via UI Automation: NVDA can now activate buttons and other controls in browse mode.
    
    Description of development approach
    UIA NVDAObject's doAction method: if the element cannot be invoked or selected or toggled, then NotImplementedError is raised.
    UIA BrowseMode document's _activateNVDAObject method: Rather than just trying to activate the given object with its doAction method, instead start at the given object and move up its ancestors, until a call to doAction succeeds. I.e. activates the given object or its closest ancestor that supports performing actions.

    WASAPI: Recover after the device is reconfigured or leaves exclusive mode. (#15783)
    
    Fixes #15758. Fixes #15775.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When another application takes exclusive control of NVDA's audio output device, NVDA can no longer speak. There's nothing we can do about this and it's reasonable that we log errors in this case. However, previously, when the other application released exclusive control of the device, NVDA would still fail to speak. Similar behaviour has been observed when the sampling rate is changed with certain audio drivers.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA now resumes audio if the configuration of the output device changes or another application releases exclusive control of the device.
    
    Description of development approach
    In WasapiPlayer::feed, as well as attempting reopen for AUDCLNT_E_DEVICE_INVALIDATED, reopen also for AUDCLNT_E_NOT_INITIALIZED. This handles the case that we tried to reopen previously due to an invalidated device and failed.
    In WasapiPlayer::stop, if either of these error codes is returned by WASAPI, just ignore them. The device is clearly stopped anyway. Previously, these errors got propagated to Python, which broke SpeechManager and stopped speech from being attempted at all. That in turn meant that feed was never called and thus reopen was never attempted.
    In WasapiPlayer::feed's reopenUsingNewDev, the hr result code was being accidentally shadowed and thus never returned to the caller. This meant that reopen failures were never raised as exceptions and thus never logged. This has now been fixed.
    Previously, due to an oversight, we weren't setting the ctypes restype for wasPlay_open. This meant that errors from this function were silently ignored. This is really a bit of drive-by cleanup and isn't necessary to fix this bug, but should make debugging easier if we hit problems here in future.

    WASAPI: Switch back to the preferred device if it becomes available. (#15781)
    
    Fixes #15759.
    Summary of the issue:
    If the audio output device is set to something other than the default and that device is (or becomes) unavailable (e.g. it is disconnected), NVDA will switch to the default device. However, when that device becomes available again (e.g. it is reconnected), NVDA continues to use the default device instead of switching back to the configured device. Worse, this can't be fixed by opening the audio preferences and pressing OK, since the Settings dialog only looks at the configuration and doesn't realise that the WASAPI code has fallen back to the default device.
    Description of user facing changes
    If the audio output device is set to something other than the default and that device becomes available again after being unavailable, NVDA will now switch back to the configured device instead of continuing to use the default device. (#15759)
    Description of development approach
    1. Pass the device name to the WasapiPlayer C++ code instead of the device id. This means that WasapiPlayer is created with the device name of the preferred device, even if that device is unavailable, allowing us to manage that in the C++ code.
    2. Removed wasPlay_getDevices and its Python callers, since they are no longer needed.
    3. Changed WasapiPlayer::open to detect whether the specified device is unavailable using an error code. If so, it falls back to the default device. We leave the preferred device name alone so we can use it later.
    4. If the device is unavailable, WasapiPlayer::feed still falls back to the default device, but again does not clear the device name.
    5. In NotificationClient, we now track device state change notifications in the same way we track default device changes.
    6. In WasapiPlayer::feed, we now handle device state changes similar to how we handle default device changes.
    7. If a device state change occurs, we scan for the preferred device by name. If it is available, we switch back to that.

    After that, NVDA won't respond to commands or events. It logs input, but that's it. Eventually, I'll see a watchdog freeze error:
    
    ERROR - watchdog.waitForFreezeRecovery (15:56:16.715) - watchdog (18804):
    Core frozen in stack! (15.582445899999584 seconds)

    We copy the WeakKeyDictionary's keys to avoid an issue like this. However, that isn't enough. It seems that an instance gets added to the dictionary while keys() is running. My guess is that we switched threads while keys() was running and some other thread cached a property.
    
    invalidateCaches failing for a single pump isn't really a big deal. The real nasty problem is that we don't catch the exception in the core pump, so we don't clean up correctly, which means the pump never runs again!
    
    I'm not able to reproduce this reliably. It seems to have started pretty recently. I'm wondering whether it is somehow related to the switch to Python 3.11.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fixed the freeze.
    
    Description of development approach
    Tracking this down is probably going to be pretty difficult. Even if/when we do, a correct solution is unclear. We could have a lock for the cache, but that could detriment performance for a cache which was implemented precisely to improve performance.
    
    For now, this change just catches the exception from invalidateCaches in the core pump and logs it. Missing one cache invalidation isn't a big deal; we'll just handle it in the next pump. It's not clean, but I think it's a pragmatic first step to deal with the clear and present danger. And we should never, ever let unhandled exceptions break us out of the core pump anyway.

    Keep a backup of a corrupted config when reinitializing it (#15779)
    
    Related to #14424 and #14412
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In some situation, the configuration file nvda.ini may be corrupted. This can happen if the user has edited the file manually or in some cases when NVDA is downgraded. It may also happen in the case of a bug during the development phase of NVDA (alpha releases) or of add-ons.
    
    When the configuration file is corrupted, it cannot be used. Thus NVDA deletes it and starts with a brand new config. It also warns the user with a message box indicating that the config has been reset and that more information can be found in the log. However in some case, the user may want to fix the issues in the corrupted file manually instead of re-creating all the parameters from the new config.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Before re-creating a new config, a backup of the old corrupted file is saved so that the user can turn back to it if they want. The logged message also indicates the presence of this file.

    Fix corrupted config error (#15691)
    
    Fixes #15690
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Critical error when starting NVDA with a corrupted config file.
    
    During config initialization, an error is logged. To check if it should play an error sound, NVDA imports nvwave, which in turn imports nvdaHelper, which imports versionInfo, where "_" is not yet defined since translations are not initialized.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    If the configuration file is corrupted, NVDA will not fail starting anymore, but will reinitialize the configuration to default as it did in NVDA 2023.1 and before.
    
    Description of development approach
    First I have used buildVersion module in nvdaHelper instead of versionInfo since the latter contains localized information that we do not use. But it was not enough since "_" (underscore is still missing when importing eventHandler or api
    Thus, I have implemented an extension point notified when an error is logged and with a handler responsible of playing the error sound. This handler is registered when nvwave audio is iinitialized. More details in Fix corrupted config error #15691 (review).
    Also, when investigating the issue and working on this PR, I have fixed the following minor issues:
    
    Removed two lines log.debugWarning("", exc_info=True), and used the exc_info in the log.warning just above. Indeed, during config initialization, log level is not yet known and thus the exc_info information is not known during startup if needed.
    Do not provide a write function when loading the config if the config file name is None since it just generates an erronous warning indicating that I am using a read only file system.

    playWaveFile: Repeatedly call stop until we're certain the previous file playback has been stopped. (#15763)
    
    Fixes #15757.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Asynchronously playing multiple files in quick succession can block while one of the files plays. However, async playback should never block.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA no longer sometimes freezes briefly when multiple sounds are played in rapid succession.
    
    Description of development approach
    There are several race conditions where the background thread might feed audio after we call stop in the main thread. Some of these are difficult to fix with locks because they involve switches between Python and blocking native code. We now just keep calling stop until we know that the backgroundd thread is done, which means it was successfully stopped. We know when the background thread is done because it sets fileWavePlayer to None.

    WasapiWavePlayer: Don't explicitly remove the instance from the instances map in the destructor. (#15754)

    80057872
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA no longer sometimes freezes when speaking a large amount of text.
    
    Description of development approach
    Previously, WasapiWavePlayer's __del__ method removed itself from the _instances map. However, a WeakValueDictionary actually removes the reference itself when the object dies. A weakref callback can run before __del__ in some cases, which would mean that the item was already removed, resulting in this KeyError.
    
    To fix this, we just don't explicitly remove the item and rely entirely on WeakValueDictionary to do this.

    Regression from #12551
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Run NVDA with a touchscreen computer and try tapping on the screen in rapid succession (for example, when invoking an object). The touch gesture fails due to a change in wxPython, where Timer.Start expects integers only, not floats.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No errors or issues when using touch navigation
    
    Description of development approach
    Add typing to touchTracker to better understand the cause of the issue.

    Compile NVDA with Visual Studio 2022 (#14313)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Although NVDA can be locally built with Visual Studio 2022, Official builds on appveyor are built with Visual Studio 2019, and even local builds still require the VS 2019 build tools, as that is what the microsoft-ui-uiAutomation project requires by default.
    As Visual Studio 2022 has been out for some time now, NvDA should move to this version officially. This would remove the need for developers to have multiple versions installed, and NVDA can take advantage of improvements in the latest version (E.g. faster compile time).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    microsoft-ui-uiAutomation sconscript: instruct msbuild to use the same platform toolset as the rest of NVDAHelper by passing in the PlatformToolset build variable created from the MSVC_VERSION SCons variable. This removes the need for the VS 2019 build tools to be installed when compiling with VS 2022.
    Instruct appveyor to use its VS 2022 system image.
    Update the NVDA docs to no longer mention VS 2019.
    
    Aldo disables notepad system tests. These have been unreliable for some time and become much more flakey on this image.

    WASAPI: Track the total number of frames buffered so far rather than the duration of audio. (#15745)
    
    Fixes #15739.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When there are several consecutive utterances of speech such as during say all or spelling, the pauses between utterances gradually decrease over time.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When using say all or commands which spell text, pauses between sentences or characters no longer gradually decrease over time.
    
    Description of development approach
    Previously, the WASAPI code accumulated the total duration of ms buffered so far. To do this, we converted from the number of frames sent to ms and added that to the total ms. This conversion isn't perfect, which meant we continually accumulated conversion errors. This resulted in the callbacks gradually getting ever more inaccurate (earlier) until the stream was stopped and reset.
    
    Instead, we now accumulate the total number of frames sent. We still convert to ms, since the current playback position is time-based. However, we only convert to ms on demand, so we don't accumulate conversion errors.

    Add SSML parser and speakSsml function (#15699)
    
    Preparations for #12945
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The way you can output speech using the nvda controller is pretty limited. It is not possible to control prosody parameters, for example. Also you can't easily insert pauses in speech.
    Construction of speech sequences can be pretty complex. It would if we'd have some standardized way of providing speech attributes in text.
    Description of user facing changes
    None for normal users, only developers.
    
    Description of development approach
    Documented in changelog entries. Basically:
    
    Added an SSML Parser to generate speech sequences
    Added speech.speakSsml to generate speech output using SSML.
    Support in the NVDA Controller Client will be added in a follow up.

    Fixes #7303
    Fixes #4371
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA has specific functionality for Poedit, but this is only supported in version 1.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Add support for Poedit 3.4 while dropping support for Poedit 1. Compared to the previous Poedit 1 support, support has been added to report the old source text and any translation warning. There is also an audio indication when the needs work checkbox is enabled (fuzzy messages).

    When logging role and states for dev info use names of the enum members. (#15708)
    
    Fixes #15703
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In Alphas of NVDA compiled with Python 3.11 role and states in the developer info were shown as integer values of the underlying enum members, and not as, more readable, member names. This is due to a change in Python 3.11, which adds a new base class for IntEnum and IntFlag which converts the members to string in the same way their underlying type (in this particular case integers) are formatted. Since we convert both role and states implicitly (using %s) to string in the developer info the member description is replaced with the meaningless integer value there.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Role and states are once again displayed as names in the developer info.
    
    Description of development approach
    When logging these properties we are logging their names directly, rather than converting enum members to string.

    playWaveFile: Don't create a new WavePlayer until after we have waited on the previous thread. (#15681)
    
    Fixes #15311.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When multiple wave files are played asynchronously in rapid succession without any delay between the calls, NVDA can freeze briefly and throw exceptions such as "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'feed'".
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA no longer sometimes freezes briefly when multiple sounds are played in rapid succession.
    
    Description of development approach
    Previously, playWaveFile reassigned fileWavePlayer before waiting for the previous thread to complete. If the previous thread was still cleaning up, it might set fileWavePlayer to None after this new assignment. This meant that fileWavePlayer would be None when the new thread tried to run.
    
    Instead, fileWavePlayer is now reassigned after waiting for the previous thread to complete.
    
    In addition, the inner play() function now catches and logs exceptions that occur while trying to play. This would have made this problem a little easier to debug and should make related problems easier to debug in future.

    Include python3.dll in the binary distribution for use in add-ons. (#15674)
    
    fixes #15594
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA add-ons that rely on .pyd files, like Resource Monitor, encounter compatibility issues due to the absence of python3.dll in NVDA's distribution. The issue becomes more complicated with NVDA's upgrade to Python 3.11, as it necessitates manually bundling multiple versions of python3.dll to maintain backward compatibility.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    In the setup.py file, bundle python3.dll from sys.base_prefix, which should be the python version used to build NVDA.

    Expose number of rows/lines on multiline braille displays (#15386)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Currently, NVDA assumes that braille displays always have one line of output. There are no native braille drivers in NVDA that support multi line displays.
    However, BRLTTY supports a few multi line displays such as the Canute and the DotPad. A first step to supporting these displays would be to treat them as one large display so we can at least output to all their cells. Multi line displays now crash the BRLTTY driver.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Multi line braille displays can now be used through BRLTTY and will no longer cause the driver to crash. Please note that the display is handled as one large continuous display and no specific features exist to use the multiple braille lines for multi line output.
    
    Description of development approach
    The BRLTTY driver only reads the number of columns and uses that as numCells. This causes a crashing braille driver with multi line displays, since we send not enough cells to fill the display.
    
    This PR adds numCols and numRows properties to the BrailleDisplayDriver class and the default for numCells is to return the total number of cells on the display. Setting numCells is still supported for single line displays, but for multi line displays this will raise a ValueError and numCols/numRows should be set explicitly.
    
    The BRLTTY driver is modified to set numRows/numCols correctly based on the info from BrlAPI.

    addonHandler: install ngettext function when calling initTranslation (#15661)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Currently, it is not possible to use gettext plural forms in addons.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Nothing
    
    Description of development approach
    Refactored installing of translation functions.
    Now they are defined in list just above initTranslation function, and set in the caller module itself instead of adding these functions in frame_globals.

    soffice: Support text attrs according to IA2 spec (#15649)
    
    Fixes #15648
    
    Summary of the issue:
    So far, LibreOffice was using custom attribute and value
    names for reporting text attributes. Spelling errors were
    not reported via any attribute. NVDA was using the presence
    of a specific underline as heuristic to detect and report
    spelling errors.
    This works for some cases, but e.g. does not cause misspelled
    words on a line being annonced as such when reading a
    line in LibreOffice Writer (issue #15648).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Announcement of text attributes also works with
    LibreOffice version 24.2 and above.
    When announcing a line in LibreOffice Writer, misspelled
    words are announced as such with LibreOffice version 24.2
    and above.
    
    Description of development approach
    Switch LibreOffice from using custom text attribute names
    and values to using attributes according to the IAccessible2
    text attributes specification
    ( https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/accessibility/iaccessible2/textattributes )
    instead and implement reporting of the "invalid:spelling;"
    attribute for misspelled words:
    
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/157804
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/157845
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/157867
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/157939
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/158088
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/158089
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/158090
    
    These changes are contained in LibreOffice >= 24.2.
    
    Adapt NVDA to evaluate those text attributes by
    using the already existing implementation from
    the IA2TextTextInfo base class in
    SymphonyTextInfo._getFormatFieldAndOffsets.
    
    For backwards-compatibility with LibreOffice
    versions <= 7.6, keep support for the legacy
    attributes and move the handling for that into
    a new helper method
    SymphonyTextInfo_getFormatFieldFromLegacyAttributesString.
    
    For the case where the legacy attributes are used,
    the text attribute string starts with "Version:1;"
    (s. the LibreOffice code dropped in
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/158090 ),
    so use that as a criterion what code path to take.
    
    Extract another helper method and address some of the
    pre-existing lint issues, but silence
    the C901 one for the method that was extracted to handle
    the legacy attributes
    ("'SymphonyTextInfo._getFormatFieldFromLegacyAttributesString' is
    too complex (27)").
    It's at least already less complex than the single
    one was before.

    Closes #15635
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Touch handler's touchSupported function and the user guide continues to check (or document requirement) for Windows 8 when minimum OS is Windows 8.1.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Edited the user guide and context help to point out that touch support requires a touch-capable hardware and that NVDA must be installed, removing wording on Windows 8 requirement.
    
    Description of development approach
    Edit touchHandler.touchSupported function to remove check for Windows 8 as Windows 8.1 is the minimum OS required, as wel as edited parts of the user guide dealing with touch support.

    Update braille when control+v, control+x, control+y, control+z, backspace or control+backspace is pressed and UIA not used in ms word (#15491)
    
    fixes #3276
    
    Summary of the issue:
    After paste, cut, redo, undo, backspace or control+backspace braille line was not necessarily updated when using object model.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Braille line and review position should always be updated when using object model ("Use UI Automation to access Microsoft Word document controls" is not set to always in NVDA's advanced settings category), and paste (control+v), cut (control+x), redo (control+y) or undo (control+z / alt+backspace) is pressed. Braille should be also updated when using object model and backspace or control+backspace is pressed and held down.
    
    Braille and review position are also updated when using UIA, and braille is tethered to review and review follows caret.
    
    Description of development approach
    To get control+v, control+x, control+y, control+z and alt+backspace to work, added helper script script_updateBrailleAndReviewPosition to NVDAObjects.IAccessible\winword.WordDocument, and assigned corresponding keyboard shortcuts to it. Minor modification of event_caret so that braille is always updated when caret event is executed from script_updateBrailleAndReviewPosition. To update braille always when backspace or control+backspace are pressed and held down, overridden _backspaceScriptHelper function.
    
    In addition, to get braille updated when tethered to review and when review follows caret, modified event_textChange in UIA\wordDocument.py.

    Closes #15618
    
    Summary of the issue:
    PR #13366 changed a way in which NVDA maps an app module to a given executable. In the process several old app modules were marked as deprecated (they show warnings on import). This is pretty noticeable when building developer documentation scons devDocs.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    Deprecated app modules and supporting functions from appModuleHandler were removed. The app Module for Azardi which cannot be imported by Sphinx was renamed, and mapped to Azardi's binary.

    Update to flake8 4.0.1. (#15636)
    
    Discussion in #15299
    Unblocks PR #15546
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The version of Flake8 we're using is extremely old. While it worked well up to now, it does not support some newer syntactic construct in recent versions of Python (in particular walrus operator). Unfortunately we cannot update to the latest release, since it does not support flake8-tabs, nor linting a diff (the latter can be achieved using external tools).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    Flake8 is updated to the version 4.0.1. This is the last version which supports flake8-tabs, and it also recognizes various newer language constructs in Python, by the simple fact that it was released almost 2.5 years after the version we're using currently.

    Revert "NVDAObject.presentationType: groupings with position information but no name and no description should still be treated as content I.e. announced in focus ancestry. (#14878)" (#15638)
    
    This reverts commit bcc7f25.
    Link to issue number:
    Reverts pr #14878
    Closes #15324
    Summary of the issue:
    Traditionally, NvDA has only ever announced groupings in the focus ancestry if they have a name or description.
    Recently Microsoft had been placing unlabeled groupings within context menus in Office and other places, to denote visual spacing. Microsoft had also recently been exposing position info (x of y) on these groupings.
    In order to take advantage of this new info, through suggestion from Microsoft, in pr #14878 NVDA started announcing these unalabeled groupings, if they had position info. the advantage being that the blind user would then have a much better idea of how these context menu items were grouped, and just how many were in each section.
    However, it is very clear based on user feedback, that there are way too many small groupings for the extra speech to outway missing info. There are many groupings in these context menus with only 1 or 2 items, greatly slowing down a user's navigation.
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will again no longer report unlabeled gorupings in the focus ancestory.
    Description of development approach
    Reverts pr #14878.
    this pr also tightens up the detection of labels for groupings and similar controls to ignore names and descriptions that only contain whitespace. This is necessary as in some builds of Office, Microsoft also started exposing a space character on the name of unlabeled groupings in order to force screen readers to announce the unlabeled groupings.

    Indicate that setting column/row headers in Word tables does not work for UIA (#15617)
    
    Fixes #13006
    
    Summary of the issue:
    UIA has become the default in Word for people with recent versions of Word and running Windows 11. When they try to set the column/row headers in tables with NVDA+shift+C/R, the command does not work and they are confused.
    The first row and the first column are however automatically treated as headers.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Following the discussion in #13006, ^more specifically #13006 (comment), and considering that:
    
    the headers are usually in the first row or column in of the tables,
    Some work is needed on Microsoft's side to make our traditional headers work with UIA,
    it has been decided to accept and document this limitation of being able to have headers only on the first row/column.
    Thus the User Guide has been updated.
    
    Also, in Word documents when using UIA, NVDA+shift+C/R now report an information so that user know that these commands are not supported nor needed anymore.
    
    Notes:
    When this fix is released in a stable release, we can evaluate if this information is enough for people or if they keep on asking the old way to manage column/row headers; we can then consider reopening #13006 (or opening a new similar issue) if needed.
    
    Description of development approach
    Two script added in the class for Word UI§A documents. These script have no description since they do not need to be discovered nor remapped in the Input gesture dialog. They're just here to give information to people trying to use the old way to handle row/column headers.

    Add docs note for reporting translation issues (#15631)
    
    Fixes #15627
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Sometimes, people want to report or even fix translation or localization issues in NVDA's GitHub.
    
    However, translation is not performed through NVDA GitHub's repo but through SVN repo.
    
    Translation issues are usually reported through various local communities (e.g. user mailing lists) or on the translator's mailing list. This seems to work quite well, at least in the French community.

    Remove deprecated speechDictHandler.speechDictVars. (#15629)
    
    Closes #15614
    
    Summary of the issue:
    speechDictHandler.speechDictVars was marked as deprecated in PR #15021. Unfortunately since the module was not imported anywhere in core py2exe failed to bundle it, which made it impossible to import this code in binary versions of NVDA. Additionally warning which was raised when importing speechDictHandler.speechDictVars was problematic when building developer documentation. Since this API breakage was already included in two releases of NVDA, it was decided to remove the code and document the removal.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None - this only removes deprecated code.
    
    Description of development approach
    The deprecated code is removed. Change log is updated to document the removal for add-ons developers.

    Move the column Status in the Add-on Store GUI (#15621)
    
    Fixes #15069
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In the Add-on Store GUI the Status column is the last one. However, the status information is much more important for users than Author. Users wanting to hear the status information when an add-on is selected in the GUI need to wait for the whole line to be read or to use additional object navigation commands. This is less efficient.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The column "Status" is now located just after the add-on's name.
    
    As discussed in #15069, both version numbers and status are important informations in the Updatable add-on tab. However, it's important to keep a quite similar order between tabs to allow a smoother UX.
    
    Description of development approach
    In AddonListField enum, moved the status item in second position.

    Replace deprecated threading methods (#15615)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Running Python 3.11 build, there are deprecation DEBUGWARNING's related to threading package.
    
    From Python 3.10 What's new:
    
    The following threading methods are now deprecated:
    
    threading.currentThread => threading.current_thread()
    threading.activeCount => threading.active_count()
    threading.Condition.notifyAll => threading.Condition.notify_all()
    threading.Event.isSet => threading.Event.is_set()
    threading.Thread.setName => threading.Thread.name
    threading.thread.getName => threading.Thread.name
    threading.Thread.isDaemon => threading.Thread.daemon
    threading.Thread.setDaemon => threading.Thread.daemon
    Among these only threading.Event.isSet and threading.Thread.setDaemon are used in NVDA's codebase.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No more such deprecation warning in the log.
    
    Description of development approach
    Replace the deprecated methods by their replacing method or attribute.
    
    Since all these replacement method or attribute are available in Python 3.7, this PR is opened against master and can be merged before Python 3.11 switch, in preparation.

    Move getFormattedStacksForAllThreads from watchdog to logHandler, to fix build of developer documentation. (#15616)
    
    Related to #12971 problem caused by PR #14899
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When trying to build developer documentation with Sphinx, many modules failed to be parsed
    
    Description of development approach
    getFormattedStacksForAllThreads is moved from watchdog to the logHandler, which avoids these warnings. Appropriate backwards compatibility is added to watchdog, to make sure add-on authors are warned to use the moved function from logHandler in the future.

    Allow contributors to self-credit changes (#15602)
    
    Discussed in #15600
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA greatly relies on community contributors.
    Many of the changes NVDA receives is thanks to community contributions.
    Currently, these contributions are largely uncredited and require users to:
    
    check contributors.txt, which is rarely updated and doesn't show what contributions the contributors have provided
    check pull requests referenced in the change log file
    check copywrite headers in NVDAs source code
    Description of user facing changes
    Allows contributors to credit themselves when contributing to NVDA, by adding their GitHub username to the changelog entry.
    This creates a link to the contributions that the GitHub user has made to NVDA.
    
    For example, a change log entry would look like:
    
    Added support for Bluetooth Low Energy HID Braille displays. (15470, alexmoon)
    Description of development approach
    Update the contribution docs to note that contributors can self-credit changes if they wish.
    
    Add processing for the changelog file to auto-link contributors GitHub contributions.

    Add more detail to release process (#15607)
    
    Link to issue number:
    Relates to nvaccess/addon-datastore-validation#33
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Information was lacking on the stability of the add-on API and translation strings at various stages of the release process.
    This makes the work required or expected for add-on developers and translators unclear.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Expands release process to include more information for translators and add-on developers.

    Reduce verbosity when reporting Excel cell formatting (#15560)
    
    When requesting for cell formatting information in Excel (NVDA+F), there is over-verbose information:
    
    "no border lines" is often reported, since Excel files with default borders are quite common
    "background pattern none" is almost always reported since cells with other background patterns are very rare
    Description of user facing changes
    When formatting information is requested with NVDA+F, we will not report anymore a lack of specific formatting for border lines or for background pattern. This formatting will still be reported during navigation if the corresponding option is enabled in document formatting settings (respectively "cell borders" and "color").
    
    In that sense, we follow the logic used for other formatting attributes that have a negative state (lack of such formatting) such as bold/italic/etc. E.g.: "no bold" is not formatted upon NVDA+F request, but it is still reported while navigating from bold to no bold if the corresponding doc formatting option is enabled.
    
    Description of development approach
    Do not provide info on background pattern in formatting info fields and changed the logic in speech.py to handle this.
    
    For UIA, nothing is done since NVDA does not report borders or background pattern for Excel cells when UIA is enabled.

    Default gesture for the screen curtain (#15590)
    
    Closes #10560
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The screen curtain is missing a default gesture (working out of the box). Users want to have a default gesture in order not to have to define one themselves.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA+control+escape is defined as default gesture.
    
    The gesture has been discussed in #10560:
    
    The main key is quite easy to find on a keyboard; e.g. PrintScreen is much harder because it's not always at the same place or sometimes behind Fn key.
    Usage of punctuation key for main key should be avoided because it differs from a local keyboard layout to another. Even if it may be translated by translators, the issue remains for people switching their keyboard layout. Punctuation keys are better suited for personal gestures.
    shortcut using 3 keys and not two due to the probable infrequency of use with respect to other gestures/commands
    with this gesture, there is no risk to activate the screen curtain by accident.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added in script's decorator and updated the documentation.

    soffice: Make status bar announcement work for dialogs, LO >= 24.2 (#15592)
    
    Fixes #15591
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Commit 62536a9
    ("soffice: Implement methods for status bar announcement (#14933)") added support for status bar announcement in LibreOffice by searching for it in the a11y tree. For performance reasons, only objects of specific roles are considered when traversing the tree. The DIALOG and OPTIONPANE roles, needed to find the status bar in Writer's "Edit Contour" dialog were not taken into account yet, so the status bar was not found and could therefore not be announced when pressing NVDA+End.
    
    In addition, the status bar object in dialogs like that one did not have the proper role in LibreOffice yet.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Status bar announcement for LibreOffice using the NVDA+End keyboard shortcut now also works for dialogs and with the upcoming LibreOffice version 24.2.
    
    Description of development approach
    LibreOffice is adapted to expose the proper role for the status bar in dialogs like the one mentioned above:
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/157659
    
    The DIALOG and OPTIONPANE roles are now also considered by NVDA when traversing the a11y tree to find the status bar.
    
    In addition, the FRAME role is also taken into account, which is needed to support finding the status bar in the default application window with LibreOffice >= 24.2, see commit message of this LibreOffice change for more details: https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/157658
    
    Add a check whether the statusbar children have the 'IAccessibleTextObject' member before accessing it.

    Update UIAutomationClient comInterfaces (#15522)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    We plan to update all dependencies where possible in 2024.1.
    The comInterfaces for UIAutomationClient are manually maintained compared to other comInterfaces.
    This is due to the regression risk of this being automatically updated on appveyor, which uses an older version of Windows.
    In preparation for python 3.11, an update to UIAutomationClient is ideal.
    Performing this early allows for maximal alpha testing
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None, ideally just performance enhancements
    
    Description of development approach
    Built with Windows 11 22H2 22621.2283.
    Follow steps in source/comInterfaces/readme.md to build with Windows 11 and updated Visual Studio 2022.

    Honor useSpellingFunctionality parameter when reporting shortcuts (#15572)
    
    Closes #15566
    Fix-up of #14900 / #15373.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #14900 / #15373., spelling mode was used (CharacterModeCommand) no matter the state of the "Use spelling functionality" option.
    
    The use spelling functionality exists because some old SAPI synth do not support spelling mode correctly. For them, this option needs to be honored.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Use spelling functionality option will now be honored when reporting shortcuts.
    
    Description of development approach
    See logic in the code.
    If use spelling functionality option is disabled, the key is just reported as is.

    Strip accelerator keys from certain menu items (#15596)
    
    Fixes #15588
    Replaces #15589
    Follow-up of #15364
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Among changes made in #15364, the accelerator key for the item "Reload plugins" in "Tools" menu has be modified to "E".
    Users of NVDA remote add-on have complained that it conflicts with this add-on's accelerator key, that is being used for many years.
    
    Usually, NVDA defines the shortcut keys and the add-ons should adapt to it. Given the popularity of NVDA Remote and it's age in the community though, NV Access may accept this case as a valid exception to this rule.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Strip accelerator keys from "reload plugins" and "run com registration fixing tool".
    
    Description of development approach
    When removing the accelerator key for reload plugins, "r" becomes the implicit key. This conflicts with explicit key for the COM reg tool, so both should be removed in the mean time.

    soffice: Announce actually deleted text on Ctrl+backspace (#15558)
    
    Fixes #15436
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The base class implementation
    EditableText#_backspaceScriptHelper for handling the Ctrl+Backspace keyboard shortcut retrieves the text to announce as deleted by expanding the text info to the corresponding text unit and then retrieving the text. This gives an incorrect result in at least Libreoffice Writer, where that would return a string just containing the space character when removing a word followed by a space using the Ctrl+backspace keyboard shortcut.
    (Writer's IAccessibleText::textAtOffset implementation that gets used in IA2TextTextInfo#_getWordOffsets handles the space as a separate word, but Ctrl+backspace removes both, the actual word and following whitespace.)
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When removing a word followed by whitespace in Libreoffice Writer, the actually removed text is announced.
    
    Description of development approach
    Instead of separately retrieving the text for a word, override the default implementation in the LibreOffice app module and announce the actually removed text when handling Ctrl+backspace.
    Use the caret position before and after the text has been removed to identify what the removed text is.

    Sapi4: Only send prosody commands when there is prosody in the sequence (#15583)
    
    Fixes #15580
    Follow up of #15502
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #15502, I fixed some regressions regarding capital pitch changes introduced in #15271. This meant that we'd add prosody commands to every speech sequence to support a specific version of IBM TTS that seemed to need that. However, it introduced a regression in that it was no longer possible to change speech parameters using the gui.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    It is again possible to change SAPI4 parameters using the GUI.
    
    Description of development approach
    Only add blank prosody commands when there is any prosody in the sequence. IF not, don't do anything.

    Summary of the issue:
    Square brackets appear around an URL in the User Guide; probably an incorrect t2t syntax:
    
    For an introductory tutorial, please refer to [https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/regex.html].
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Modified with a full labeled link; the raw URL is now not visible anymore.
    
    While at it and since we now have NVDA+K, I have replaced other raw URLs of the User Guide by full links with a visible label and no visible raw URL anymore. It makes the User Guide more smoothly readable.
    
    Also, links pointing to dessci.com now redirect to wiris.com. Thus, I have replaced links pointing to dessci.com with links targeting an equivalent resource on wiris.com.
    
    Description of development approach
    Writing in t2t syntax.

    Add mapping for "multiple line" JAB state to NVDA state (#15557)
    
    Fixes #14609
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA doesn't report multi-line state for Java Access Bridge components that expose it.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will correctly report multi-line state in applications using Java Access Bridge.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added mapping from "multiple line" JAB state to NVDA multiline state. There is already a mapping from "multi_line" JAB state to NVDA state, but the string was incorrect, so NVDA didn't announce it. JAB uses the string from the following resource file: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/516cfb135f7e5fefaf6e6f2928f6ecb88806f1ef/src/java.desktop/share/classes/com/sun/accessibility/internal/resources/accessibility_en.properties#L114. Existing "multi_line" value probably comes from the name of Java's AccessibleState.MULTI_LINE const, but it doesn't seem to have ever been used as a resource value after looking at the git history. I still kept it in the mapping to ensure backwards compatibility: while unlikely, it's possible that in older Java versions the value was "multi_line".

    When pickling addon state use only builtin types, and add unit test for the pickling and unpickling process. (#15556)
    
    Fixes #15554
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When pickling add-ons state it is necessary to use only builtin types, so that it can be loaded in older versions of NVDA. IN PR #15439 the backCompatToVersion was mistakenly pickled as a custom named tuple MajorMinorPatch.
    This means it is impossible to start older versions of NVDA with the config from the latest beta NVDA crashes on startup.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    It should be once again possible to start older versions of NVDA with the config used with the latest beta.
    
    Description of development approach
    The manualOverridesAPIVersion is pickled as a standard tuple. To make sure similar regressions are not introduced I have added unit test covering various scenarios of converting state to, and loading it from, pickled data. Note that I have intentionally not used pickle files, since when the given custom data type is added to NVDA it will always be unpickled successfully.

    Remove incorrect change log item (#15552)

    Summary of the issue:
    Change log contains an incorrect item
    Fixed performance issues with Task Manager and some Windows versions. (#6245)
    
    Indeed #6245. It had been erroneously closed as duplicate of #15519 before being reopened again. Indeed, #15519 is about tagging the task list as bad UIA window, whereas #6245 was already an issue before trying to consider the task list as good UIA window.

    Add SysListView32 to badUIAWindowClassNames (#15542)
    
    Fixes #15541
    Reverts #15295
    Reopens #15283
    
    See also #15503, #15333
    
    Summary of the issue:
    There are several known cases where UIA is not correctly supported for SysListView32.
    Reliability History is the most recently raised, with task manager and management console being raised earlier.
    As this is close to a beta, it is safer to just declare SysListView32 as bad for UIA for all applications.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Reopens issues with SysListView32 and windows forms applications
    Fixes issue with reading Reliability History, and potentially also resource monitor.
    
    Description of development approach
    declare SysListView32 as bad for UIA for all applications.

    Add-on store: Handle bulk install (#15350)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    To be able to stress test the add-on installation system, a method of bulk installing add-ons is useful.
    There is also a general request from users to be able to perform bulk actions like installing, updating or removing add-ons.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Users are now able to bulk install add-ons.
    This can be done by selecting multiple add-ons in the available add-ons tab, then activating the context menu on the selection and choosing the install action.
    
    Description of development approach
    Create a separate context menu for bulk actions. This creates an API for future bulk actions.

    Report more object properties on mouse enter (#15518)
    
    Fixes #15420
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When the mouse option "Report role when mouse enters object" is enabled, NVDA reports the role of objects when the mouse enters them. However, the role is in pretty insufficient in many situations, for example:
    
    Check boxes: checked state is missing
    Table cells: coordinates are missing
    Description of user facing changes
    Renamed "Report role when mouse enters object" to "Report object when mouse enters it"
    When enabled, additional properties (such as states, cell coordinates, table info) will be reported
    
    Description of development approach
    Implemented some additional logic to speak objects with reason controlTypes.OutputReason.MOUSE, and made event_mouseMove use speech.speakObject.

    Recognize Windows version 10.0.22631 as Windows 11 2023 Update (Version 23H2) (#15540)
    
    Closes #15530
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Recognize Windows version 10.0.22631 as Windows 11 2023 Update (Version 23H2).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    Edit the following files:
    
    source/winVersion: add Windows 11 23H2 data, including build number, release name, and WIN11_23H2 constant.
    Edit appx XML to state that last tested build is 10.0.22631.0.
    Add type hints for builds to release names dictionary.
    Testing strategy:
    Tested manually - make sure that, on Windows build 10.0.22631, winVersion.getWinVer() says Windows 11 23H2, which is the release name for winVersion.WIN11_23H2.

    Update SCons to version 4.5.2 (#15529)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    As part of the investment to update all NVDA dependencies, SCons needs an update to the most recent version.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Updates Scons to 4.5.2
    
    Description of development approach
    Updates requirements. As CPPDEFINES is now saved as a deque internally, I needed to convert the deque to a list before expanding it for one of the libraries.

    Fixes the announcement of cell formatting commands in Excel (#15527)
    
    Fixes #15506
    Fix-up of #14923
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When peforming tests for #14923, I have wrongly assumed that Excel cell formatting shortcuts were control+shift+2/3/4/5. This assumption was based on my tests with Excel's interface changed to English on my system. However, it seems that the keyboard layout when Excel is started has also an impact on the shortcuts containing digits (see discussion in #14923).
    The actual shortcuts are control+2/3/4/5, as described in Microsoft documentation and as confirmed starting Excel with English GUI and English keyboard layout.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    On English systems (and probably many others), Excel cell formatting shortcuts control+2/3/4/5 will have their effect reported correctly. shift+control+2/3/4/5 will not report inappropriately formatting information on English systems.
    
    Description of development approach
    Modified the gesture definition.

    Summary of the issue:
    NV Access is intending to move most of the wiki into the repository, so changes are tracked better and easier to propose.
    The release process wiki page is a prime candidate for migration.
    The release process wiki is out of date, it also contains some information that is better suited to or duplicated in other documents.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The release process wiki page is migrated to the repository.
    
    The process is updated to include more information on the timing of the stages.
    Information for testers, and developers are moved to the appropriate contributing docs.

    Add spelling for double presses of some NVDA commands (#15504)
    
    Closes #15449
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Various NVDA commands which report information spells it on second press. This was not the case for the two following commands:
    
    Report current selection
    Report clipboard text
    Moreover, the command to report focus (NVDA+Tab) support spelling the information on second press, but not the triple press version spelling it using character description.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When pressing two times NVDA+C or NVDA+shift+upArrow, the reported information will be spelt. A third press spells the information using character description. As for other similar scripts, if the selection or the clipboard text contains too many characters, the information is not spelt and the number of characters is reported instead.
    
    Similarly, the command to report focus (NVDA+Tab) has also been extended to support spelling the information using character description on third press.

    Add SysListView32 to isBadUIAWindow, fix task manager freeze (#15519)
    
    Fixes #15503
    Fixes #6245
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA is extremely slow to respond in this Task Manager task list. This is due to UIA being a bad implementation.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Task manager should now have better performance in some versions of Windows.
    
    Description of development approach
    Mark sysListView32 as a badUIAWindow for the task manager app module.
    Similar to #15348

    Fixup of #13542: Do not call IA2 install and uninstall code from NVDA itself (#15517)
    
    Fixup of #13542
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #13542, we introduced support for multi thread IA2 initialization. As part of that, the signature of the install- and uninstallIA2Support functions were changed. Somehow, it was an oversight from my end that these functions were also called from NVDAHelper.py. This causes:
    
    NVDA to always log a debug warning on exit, saying that it was unable to unregister IA2 support.
    NVDA to call installIA2Initialize without a thread Id. It is actually a miracle that the segfault we're now seeing in preliminary PY3.11 work didn't hurt us earlyer. That said, I think I've seen cases were NVDA played the startup sound and then silently crashed. I think this should be the case.
    As per point 2, given the risk of NVDA calling a code path that results in undefined behavior and possible segfaults, I strongly recommend to merge this into beta.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No crashes during NVDA startup.
    
    Description of development approach
    Removed the calls from NVDAHelper.py and no longer export the functions from NVDAHelper. The calls in NVDA core were actually obsolete, as IA2 support is registered by injection_initialize and injection_terminate. Note that the install and uninstall IA2 functions aren't called in de 64 bit loader of NVDAHelper, yet IA2 works as expected in X64 applications. Also, installIA2Support is no longer C friendly anyway. Note that an add-on author should never call these functions, therefore I don't consider this as an API breaking change.

    Fix SAPI4 prosody regressions (#15502)
    
    Fixes #15500
    Follow up of #15271
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Some SAPI4 synthesizers reset all their prosody values to their defaults when they come across prosody in a sequence.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Capital pitch changes no longer cause some SAPI4 voices to reset their rate and volume.
    
    Description of development approach
    When a sequence contains any prosody command, for the other prosody commands supported by the synth, we add commands to set them to the currently configured value.

    Re-add audio device combo box to synth select dialog (#15486)
    
    Link to issue number:
    Partially reverts #15472.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The "output device" option has been removed from the NVDA+Control+s dialog. This breaks muscle memory for long-time NVDA users and makes it very hard to blindly (without audible speech or connected Braille) change sound devices in the event of unexpected device switching.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    Selectively reverts the change in #15472 that removes the option from the synth selection dialog.
    
    Testing strategy:
    Verified that the "output device" option in both dialogs works as expected

    Depend on supported command for capital pitch change (#15433)
    
    Closes #15262
    Blocked by #15271
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When implementing a synthesizer driver, there are two ways to change pitch:
    
    Change the pitch setting
    Send a pitch command that changes the pitch for the duration of the sequence or until there is a new pitch command.
    Capital pitch change uses pitch commands to change pitch for capital letters. When doing this, it calls isSupported("pitch") on the driver, which returns True when the pitch setting is supported. However in order to support capital pitch changes, the driver should implement support for the PitchCommand instead.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    Changed all situations where isSupported("pitch") is called to generate a pitch command to check whether the PitchCommand is in supportedCommands.

    Disable "Ignore blank lines" checkbox when report indent is off (#15494)
    
    Follow-up of #15057
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In the GUI, the recent trend is to disable (grey out) the options that are not applicable due to the values of other options.
    New option "Ignore blank lines for line indentation reporting" has no sense when report indentation is OFF. Thus it should be greyed out when report indent is off.
    
    This is especially needed to reduce the number of tab presses when navigating in the Doc formatting settings dialog which contains a lot of items.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Option "Ignore blank lines for lineis greyed out when report indent is off and enabled when other indent reporting types are configured.
    
    While at it, in this PR, I have also changed the context help target for "Ignore blank lines" option. Before it was jumping by default to "Document formatting settings" paragraph; now it jumps to "Line indentation reporting" paragraph, which contains more precise information on this topic.

    Support Pitch, Rate and Volume commands properly in SAPI4 (#15271)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Pitch, volume and rate changes can be embedded in speech sequences. However, the latter two were never implemented for SAPI4. Pitch support was implemented last year, but it was pretty strictly bound to the capital pitch change setting (i.e. it didn't respect the offset on the PitchCommand.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Capital pitch change intervals might be bigger with some engines.
    
    Description of development approach
    Pitch, Volume and Rate commands are now implemented according to the respective control tags
    
    Testing strategy:
    Tested that capital pitch change still works, though the difference in pitch might be bigger now. However, I compared the capital pitch change with a real pitch change and the intervals are equal.

    Fix some issues where an NVDAObject is used where a Window is expected (#15400)
    
    Fixes #15395
    
    Summary of the issue:
    There are many instances in NVDA where we implicitly or explicitly (with typing) expect an NVDAObject but code uses properties only available for a NVDAObjects.window.Window.
    This is because most objects are Windows and usually these implicit expectations are safe.
    This PR attempts to catch some known instances where these expectations are not safe.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix error when switching to the secure desktop
    
    Description of development approach
    Improve typing and catch some likely cases where a Window should not be expected

    UX fixes for WASAPI GUI and doc (#15478)
    
    Follow-up of #15472.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    If NVDA is started with WASAPI disabled in config and if you enable WASAPI, the new audio options to control NVDA sounds along with voice and volume of NVDA sound are available. That's confusing because modifying them will not have any effect until NVDA is restarted.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Enabling or disabling audio options linked to WASAPI will be done looking at current state of WASAPI usage rather than looking at the state configured for next restart.
    
    Also added an indication in the User Guide that these options can be unavailable so that the user does not look for them when they are greyed out.
    
    Description of development approach
    Rather than checking the config, check the player currently used to determine if the WASAPI related options need to be disabled or not.

    Require change log entries to be include in the pull request (#15475)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Change log entries from contributors are currently requested to be included in the PR description rather than code changes.
    This is because entries are prone to merge conflicts, however GitHub allows you to handle these through the web UX.
    Alternatively, NV Access can always resolves these via git locally.
    
    Change log entries in the PR description are harder to review, as you cannot make suggestions using GitHub's PR review UX.
    This also adds unnecessary work for NV Access, to checkout PRs and copy paste the changes.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    contributors are encouraged to add changes directly to the changes file rather than the PR description

    Handle incompatible add-ons when upgrading/downgrading NVDA API versions (#15439)
    
    Fixes #15437
    Fixes #15412
    Fixes #15414
    
    Summary of the issue:
    There are several scenarios which need to be supported when updating/downgrading NVDA with incompatible add-ons
    
    Test Name       Upgrade from    Upgrade to      Test notes
    Upgrade to different NVDA version in the same API breaking release cycle        X.1     X.1     Add-ons which remain incompatible are listed as incompatible on upgrading. Preserves state of enabled incompatible add-ons
    Upgrade to a different but compatible API version       X.1     X.2     Add-ons which remain incompatible are listed as incompatible on upgrading. Preserves state of enabled incompatible add-ons
    Downgrade to a different but compatible API version     X.2     X.1     Add-ons which remain incompatible are listed as incompatible on downgrading. Preserves state of enabled incompatible add-ons
    Upgrade to an API breaking version      X.1     (X+1).1 All incompatible add-ons are listed as incompatible on upgrading, overridden compatibility is reset.
    Downgrade to an API breaking version    (X+1).1 X.1     Add-ons which remain incompatible listed as incompatible on downgrading. Preserves state of enabled incompatible add-ons. Blocked add-ons which are now compatible are re-enabled.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will reset compatibility overrides when updating to a different API breaking release, this means incompatible add-ons will be blocked again.
    If an add-on is blocked due to compatibility and becomes compatible, e.g. via downgrading, it will be re-enabled.
    
    Description of development approach
    Store the BACK_COMPAT_TO version in the addon state pickle.
    When updating the BACK_COMPAT_TO version, reset the incompatibility override state.

    Fix bug where NVDA would not speak until restarted after add-on installation. (#15448)
    
    Fixes #14525
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA blocks exit on modal dialogs which require an answer.
    If a message box is created after NVDA has triggered a shutdown, NVDA blocks exit on the message box, even after synthesizers have been terminated.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix bug where NVDA would not speak until restarted after add-on installation.
    Similar bugs with the same root cause may also be fixed.
    
    Description of development approach
    Open, pending modal dialogs should block the exit of NVDA.
    To prevent a deadlock NVDA should prevent opening new modal dialogs if the core shutdown has been triggered.

    Add-on store: Clear download cache where appropriate (#15471)
    
    Fixes #15469
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Cancelled/failed downloads from the add-on store are not cleared.
    This prevents future attempts at installation.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Users should now be able to install add-ons after cancelling or if the download fails
    
    Description of development approach
    Clear the download cache:
    
    when an add-on download fails/cancels
    when exiting the store
    when opening the store

    Force incompatibility for NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin versions 12.0.8 or below (#15443)
    
    Follow-up of #15402
    
    See #15402 (comment)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    As with Tony's Enhancements add-on, "NVDA global commands extension" add-on (name = NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin) version 12.0.8 or below causes speech muted with WASAPI, so with NVDA 2023.3beta1.
    
    This add-on is not in NVDA store but is popular in French community as well as in international community; it is translated in 10 languages.
    
    A fix release (13.0) has already been created by the author @paulber19 on August 20. But we cannot ensure that people will have updated before updating NVDA.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No problem when running NVDA with NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin 12.0.8: NVDA is speaking.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added this add-on and its version in the list to force incompatibility.

    Fix issue with parsing version string when checking if add-on is force disabled (#15444)
    
    Fixes #15440
    Fixup of #15402
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Some add-ons have version strings which we cannot parse for ordering.
    When checking if an add-on should be force disabled, we don't handle the case where the version string cannot be parsed.
    If a version string cannot be parsed, we should assume the add-on should not be force disabled, instead of throwing an error
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Add-ons which have unparsable version strings now work again
    
    Description of development approach
    If a version string cannot be parsed, we should assume the add-on should not be force disabled, instead of throwing an error

    Description of user facing changes

    Align horizontally checkbox in add-on store GUI (#15428)
    
    Fixes #15018
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In the add-on store, the "include incompatible add-ons" checkbox is not aligned with the combobox at its left.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The checkbox will be aligned horizontally.
    
    Description of development approach
    In the guiHelper, added the wx.EXPAND flag so that it is centered vertically in the sizer.
    
    I do not know if other items may benefit from this flag; we could add them in the if clause if / when needed in the future. such Horizontal sizers are less common in NVDA's GUI however.

    The hack in 2023.3 specifically recognises older versions of the add-on as incompatible.
    The hack is not necessary with 2024.1, as the usual incompatibility warning applies when updating

    Add-on store: correctly refresh cache when filtering incompatible add-ons (#15418)
    
    Fixes #15411
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When unchecking 'Include incompatible add-ons', incompatible add-ons are still included in the list.
    This is due to the cache of the compatible add-ons being updated to include incompatible add-ons.
    This is due to a referencing problem, where the listed add-ons and the compatible add-on cache used the same reference.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Unchecking "include incompatible add-ons" should now correctly return the list to only show compatible add-ons
    
    Description of development approach
    A copy of the cache should be used instead, to prevent external functions from updating the cached copy.

    Force disable older versions of tony's enhancements add-on with 2023.3 (#15402)
    
    Tony's enhancements version 1.51 and older prevents any speech from happening when WASAPI is enabled.
    This is due to the add-on relying on private API functions.
    Now that WASAPI is enabled by default, upgrading to 2023.3 resulting in silence should be avoided if possible.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When updating to NVDA 2023.3, if tony's enhancement add-on is installed it will trigger the typical UX warning for upgrading to an API breaking release, where incompatible add-ons are force disabled.
    
    Description of development approach
    Force known versions of problematic add-ons to be considered disabled with 2023.3.
    This code should be cleaned up in 2024.1.

    Add checks for region updates (#15393)
    
    Fixes #15391
    Fixup of #15163
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Since #15163, it is much more likely that braille tries to update a region for an object that no longer exists. This is no problem at all, however in that case, the region should simply be ignored for updating and a debug warning should be logged instead.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No errors in de log while browsing
    
    Description of development approach
    a try/except around region.update, with an extra check to avoid updating regions for tree interceptors that have died.
    
    Testing strategy:
    Browsed with Firefox for some minutes, wasn't able to reproduce the issue any longer.

    Summary of the issue:
    In #14488, no documentation for the new extensionPoint was added to the master list of extension points in the developer guide.
    (I wish there was a way to remind of this when contributing extensionPoint creations)
    
    Additionally, I noticed an oddity in the documentation of the extensionPoint itself, which may or may not be intended.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Improved documentation for developers.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added a new section to the Developer Guide chapter on Extension Points, listing the new Action, winAPI.secureDesktop.post_secureDesktopStateChange.
    Fixed a terminology error in the head section of the chapter (I had previously called extensionPoints a module, when it should have been a package).
    Noticed that in the usage example given in the winAPI.secureDesktop module docstring, there was a call to notify(). AFAIK, the general consumer of this extensionPoint, who registers something to it, shouldn't also be calling notify on it. I removed that example line, replacing it with a comment to put the subsequent unregister() call in context. @seanbudd please check my reasoning.

    Remove `SecureDesktopNVDAObject`, replace with extension point (#14488)
    
    Fixes #14137
    
    Summary of the issue:
    SecureDesktopNVDAObject is used to notify the user and API consumers that NVDA has entered a secure desktop.
    This creates a valid NVDAObject, backed by the secure desktop.
    The running instance of NVDA enters sleep mode when SecureDesktopNVDAObject is focused, signifying a switch to a secure desktop. Then a new instance of NVDA in secure mode starts on the secure desktop.
    The SecureDesktopNVDAObject is unused, apart from being an API endpoint to notify consumers, as NVDA sleeps after it is created.
    
    Handling SecureDesktopNVDAObject requires special cases to be constructed.
    
    NVDA generally uses extension points for this API use case.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    SecureDesktopNVDAObject is replaced with an extension point that only provides a boolean state on the existence of the secure desktop.
    A fake NVDAObject is used to enable sleep mode while the secure desktop is active.

    Don't hide installed add-ons in available add-ons list (#15380)
    
    Fixes #15374
    
    Summary of the issue:
    At present, if you use the available add-ons category, add-ons already installed are not shown in the list.
    This is causing confusion, where users expect add-ons to listed in the available add-ons tab, regardless if installed.
    
    The main use case is the following user story:
    I am a user who has installed VeryCoolAddon. I want to recommend a friend to use it. I check in the add-on store via the "Add-on catalog" tab (formerly "Available add-ons" tab) that the add-on is still in the store and its version. Note: add-ons may be removed from the store for various reasons, so you cannot be certain if the add-on is still available in the add-on store if it is already installed.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    add-ons which are already installed will no longer be hidden in the available add-ons list
    
    Description of development approach
    Include all the same statuses in the installed add-ons tab in the available add-ons tab. (#15374)

    When announcing calculation result in Win32 calculator rely on name change events (#15377)
    
    Fixes #15230
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA's calculation announcements for Win32 calculator relies on a list of predefined keyboard commands, which, when pressed, causes the new value of the display to be announced. This assumes that at the time when gesture is sent the calculator had enough time to process it, and display the result of the calculation. While this worked before prior to #14708, after this PR NVDA no longer sleeps after sending gestures, therefore the value on calculator's display had not enough time to be updated. For users this means that after performing calculations the outdated value was read.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA once again announces correct results of the calculation.
    
    Description of development approach
    Rather than announcing the display value immediately after user pressed a key, NVDA now sets a flag signaling that the given command causes result of a calculation to appear. This flag is checked in the name change event for the display. If it is set the result is announced and the flag is restored to its default value.
    While at it I have also updated the copyright header of the module based on its log in VCS.

    Revert no longer classify (rich) edit classes as bad for UIA (#15381)
    
    Reintroduces #14285
    Fixes #15375
    Fixes #15330
    Reverts #15314
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #15314, edit and rich edit classes were no longer classified as bad for UIA. This caused the following issues:
    
    Read only edit fields in Explorer no longer read correctly, as they inherrit from both UIA and IAccessible
    UIA adds a redundant name of RichEdit Control to RichEdit controls.
    Generally spoken, removing these classes from the bad UIA classes list meant an API breaking change because Edit objects using UIA instead of legacy Edit support behave differently with regard to overriding and filtering texts, including LTR and RTL marks.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Reverted #15314. Most notably, the lag as reported in #14285 will unfortunately be reintroduced for now.
    
    Description of development approach
    Re-add the bad UIA class names again.
    Addressed issues in the explorer appmodule as pointed out in Edit controls in explorer fail when they have a native UIA implementation #15375.
    Most notably, changed class inheritance from IAccessible to Edit
    Added some small checks to overlay selection to ensure SysListView overlays won't be added on SysListView objects that don't use MSAA

    NVDA menu: add explicit shortcut keys and avoid collisions (#15364)
    
    Closes #15362
    
    Summary of the issue:
    "Add-on store" item has been added with "S" as a shortcut key in NVDA tools menu in NVDA 2023.2.
    Unfortunately "S" was already used for "Speech viewer" (as its first letter), even if it was not defined explicitly. Now that there is an explicit mapping for "Add-on store", implicit shortcut key definition for "Speech viewer" becomes masked and does not work anymore.
    
    In case the add-ons add new items in the menus with explicit definition of shortcut keys, other menu item that only use implicit definition of the shortcut key may be masked as well.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Explicitly define shortcut keys in main NVDA menu and avoid collisions (i.e. two times the same letter in the same menu).
    
    Description of development approach
    In main NVDA menu:
    
    "Tools: add explicitly "T"
    "Reset configuration to factory defaults")": Change "R" to "F" because was already used by "Revert to saved configuration"
    "Donate": add explicitly "D"
    In "Tools" submenu:
    
    "Reload plugins e": change "R" to "E" since "R" already taken by "Run COM Registration Fixing tool..."
    "Add-on store": "A" instead of "S", as discussed in Speech viewer no longer has a shortcut key in the tools menu in 2023.2 #15362 (comment), to avoid collision with "Speech viewer"
    "View log": "L" instead of "V" to be more intuitive, as discussed in NVDA menu: add explicit shortcut keys and avoid collisions #15364 (comment)
    For all other items, explicitly mark the accelerator
    Help menu:
    
    "About": Explicitly set "A"
    All other items are already explicitly marked.

    Fix background downloading of add-ons (#15379)
    
    Fixes #15347
    
    Summary of the issue:
    #15347 raises 2 issues with handling the results of downloading add-ons when the add-on list has been refreshed by switching to a different add-on list view tab.
    This is due to the download task relying on an add-on being visible in the add-on list.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Installing add-ons and then switching tabs should not result in any errors and downloads should be successful
    
    Description of development approach
    Up the max workers for downloading to 10, meaning up to 10 add-ons can be downloaded simultaneously
    Fix handling of completed downloads to be safer, use the list view model for downloading rather than just the add-on model so that the context of the add-on list view is not needed
    Fix up various misleading typing annotations
    Add an "UNKNOWN" category for add-on status rather than just causing an error, this will allow add-ons with an unknown status to appear in the incompatible add-ons tab instead of just being hidden

    Reintroduce Improve shortcut key reporting (#14900) (#15373)
    
    Fixes #10807
    Reintroduce the changes of PR #14900 that were reverted in #15237.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    See #14900 for the initial issue.
    
    #14900 had to be reverted since it caused any speech sequence containing a character mode command to spell the whole speech sequence with Code Factory driver. Although the issue is in the driver and not NVDA, it has been decided to wait for an API-breaking release to issue this fix so that Code Factory synth users be not impacted by this bug.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Same as #14900, that is:
    
    Shortcut key reporting will be improved in some cases. This applies to on-demand reporting (shift+numpad2) as well as when "Report Object Shortcut Keys" option is checked in Object presentation settings.
    The cases where it should be improved are:
    
    punctuation key, e.g. "." (dot)
    letter keys when the name of the letter is not spoken the same way as the equivalent one-letter word, e.g. "à" or "y" in French.
    Braille reporting should remain unchanged.
    Description of development approach
    Revert #15237 to reintroduce the changes in #14900 and remove change log modifications.

    There are a few issues with the current project documentation:
    
    The README is quite long, and focused largely on configuring the developer environment.
    Instead, it should be a homepage for the various aspects of the project. Detailed information should be split into their own documents.
    contributing.md is quite long and should be split similarly into the ways one can contribute to NVDA.
    There is a lot of missing information in terms of how to get started with various ways of contributing.

    Fix WASAPI option enabling/disabling when restoring advanced options (#15355)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The following advanced options are greyed out or not depending if they are applicable: "Volume of NVDA sounds" and "Volume of NVDA sounds follows voice volume". If they are applicable or not depends on other options: "Use WASAPI for audio output" and "Volume of NVDA sounds" respectively. Unfortunately, when pressing the "Restore defaults" button of the advanced panel, the options are reset to there default values, but they are not greyed out / ungreyed accordingly.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When pressing the restore default button in advanced panel, WASAPI advanced options will now be greyed out or not according to if they are applicable or not.

    Continually refresh OCR and speak new text as it appears (#15331)
    
    Replaces #11270, adding configuration.
    Fixes #2797.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Some videos include text which is graphical only with no accompanying verbalization, thus making it inaccessible to screen reader users. OCR is very useful for this purpose. However, having to repeatedly and manually dismiss and recognize is tedious and inefficient. It would be useful if NVDA could do this automatically, reporting new text as it appears.
    
    This could be useful for other scenarios as well such as virtual machines and games.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    When the user performs content recognition (e.g. NVDA+r for Windows 10 OCR), we now periodically (every 1.5 seconds) recognize the same area of the screen again. The result document is updated with the new recognition result, keeping the previous cursor position if possible.
    
    The LiveText NVDAObject is used to report any new text that has been added. LiveText honours the report dynamic content changes setting, so turning this off will prevent new text from being spoken.
    
    Because the result document is updated, this means braille is updated as well, allowing braille users to see changes as they occur.
    
    While Windows 10 OCR is local and relatively fast, other recognizers might not be; e.g. they might be resource intensive or use an internet service. Recognizers can thus specify whether they want to support auto refresh using the allowAutoRefresh attribute, which defaults to False.

    Allow excluding display drivers from automatic detection (#15200)
    
    closes #15196
    
    Summary of the issue:
    It is currently not possible to disable display drivers for automatic detection, other than the HID braille standard
    There is no obvious way for add-on bundled braille display drivers to register themselves in automatic detection.
    Description of user facing changes
    In the braille display selection dialog, when automatic is selected, there is now an additional checklistbox that allows you to disable drivers. The disabled drivers are saved in config.
    The advanced option for to disable HID braille has been removed. Users should use the new checklistbox instead. There is a config profile upgrade step to remember the user's decision about explicitly disabling HID.
    It is now possible to select the HID braille driver manually when it is disabled for automatic detection. The old option in advanced setting disabled HID completely, i.e. the driver wasn't available for manual selection either.
    Description of development approach
    Added a registerAutomaticDetection classmethod to BrailleDisplayDriver. This method is called by bdDetect.initialize. The classmethod receives a bdDetect.DriverRegistrar that contains the following methods:
    addUsbDevices: to register USB devices
    addBluetoothDevices: To register bluetooth devices
    addDeviceScanner: convenience method to register a handler to the scanForDevices extension point
    Added a supportsAutomaticDetection boolean attribute on braille display drivers. This should be set to True for bdDetect to recognize the driver.
    Removed the option from the config to enable/disable HID, instead rely on a new excludeDisplays lisst in the config that is populated by the new option in the braille display selection dialog. Note that exclusions are saved, not inclusions. This ensures that new drivers will be opt-out.
    bdDetect.Detector._queueBgScan has a backwards compatible change for its limitToDevices parameter. When None, it falls back to the list of enabled drivers. When no drivers are disabled, it checks all drivers.
    Logic from bdDetect.initialize() has been moved to the respective display drivers, calling the replacement methods on the driverRegistrar and omitting the name of the driver in the method call.

    Mark SysListView32 as bad for UIA in mmc (#15348)
    
    Fixes #15333
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #15295, we removed SysListView32 as a bad UIA class name as there are now decent UIA implementations that should be prefered over their MSAA counterparts. However, it turns out that Windows Management Console, despite advertising a native UIA implementation, offers something quite incomplete.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Working list navigation in mmc, such as in windows Services list
    
    Description of development approach
    Classify SysListView32 as Bad UIA class in the mmc app module. Note. I have also tested several other applications in Windows, including regedit, and there no UIA implementation of SysListView32 is advertised. Therefore I think this might be a onetimer.
    Ensures that whenever UIA is used wit an incomplete implementation, no errors occur by performing the necessary checks.

    Fixes to address hangs caused by WASAPI idle checks (#15349)
    
    Fixes #15150.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When WASAPI is enabled, NVDA sometimes hangs and cannot be recovered, especially when switching audio devices. The freezes all occur in WasapiWavePlayer._idleCheck when calling wasPlay_idle.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fixed the hangs.
    
    Description of development approach
    If getting the playback position fails with an error, playback has probably been interrupted; e.g. because the device disconnected. Treat this as if playback has finished so we don't wait forever and so that we fire any pending callbacks.
    Never treat a stream as idle while we're feeding audio to it. Aside from this not making any sense, we might otherwise try to sync and stop it in the main thread, which could cause hangs or crashes.

    Improve error logging when an add-on store cached add-on file is invalid (#15346)
    
    Raised due to #15345
    Fix up of #15241
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Add-ons installed from the add-on store in NVDA versions before 2023.2beta2 may have invalid encoding in their add-on store cache file.
    This causes an error to be logged, and the add-on to be treated as an externally installed add-on.
    The file name of the invalid add-on cache file is not logged with the error.
    This information is required for debugging.

    Small BRLTTY driver improvements (#15335)
    
    Partly related to issue #6483.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The BRLTTY driver was available even when there was no BRLTTY instance with BrlAPI enabled running on the local computer (the only type of connection supported for now). Opening the actual connection has quite a long timeout, so this cannot be done as an availibility check. However, BrlAPI uses named pipes in a known location, so we can use that to check for availability. In the future we might also expose this as a port selection if multiple pipes are discovered and/or we add an interface to connect to a BrlAPI server on another host over TCP.
    
    While I was working on this driver, I also marked it threadSafe and added a few more keybindings.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The BRLTTY driver will not show up in the list of braille displays if no local BRLTTY with BrlAPI enabled is running.
    More BRLTTY commands have been mapped to NVDA actions.

    Update braille independently on caret (#15163)
    
    Fixes #15115
    
    Summary of the issue:
    This extends pull request #15134 and includes pull request #15156. Collaborated with @leonardder.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Braille line is updated in terminal window when there is text change.
    
    In addition braille line is updated in any application when:
    
    braille cursor is turned on or off with gesture
    if there is selected text in edit control or document, changing "show selection" state with gesture updates braille line when otherwise supported
    Description of development approach
    Terminal window updates are handled with:
    
    NVDAObjects.behaviors.Terminal.event_textChange and
    event_UIA_notification in winConsoleUIA._NotificationsBasedWinTerminalUIA.
    Objects are passed to BrailleHandler.handleUpdate function.
    
    When braille show selection state is changed with gesture, BrailleHandler.initialDisplay function is executed.
    
    When braille cursor is toggled with gesture, BrailleHandler._updateDisplay function is executed.

    Text alignment reporting and enhancements for MS Excel cells and MS Word text (#15205)
    
    Closes #15206
    Closes #15220
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Various issues for alignment reporting:
    
    In MS Excel horizontal or vertical text alignment is not always correctly reported.
    In MS Word (legacy), text alignment is not correctly reported for "justify" and for "distrubute".
    Description of user facing changes
    Reporting text alignment in Word and Excel is now handled better in various situations. "Default" is not reported anymore since it does not give any clear indication of the position of the text.
    
    In MS Excel (no UIA) the alignment is reported as per Excel's options:
    for horizontal text alignment in cell: "General", "Centered across columns", "Repeat" and "Distribute" is now reported instead of "Default" or nothing
    for vertical alignment: "bottom" is reported instead of "default"
    In MS Word (no UIA):
    "justify" is now reported instead of "Default"
    "distribute" is now reported instead of nothing
    Description of development approach
    Standardized alignments returned by getFormatField* functions around a string enum as done in #11897. Thus, all the interfaces are impacted.

    Update triage docs - move from wiki (#15327)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The triage docs are out of date.
    Additionally, NV Access is intending to move most of the wiki into the repository, so changes are tracked better and easier to propose.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The two triage wiki pages were merged into this one document:
    
    https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/Issue-triage-help
    https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/Triage-process/
    A new section on issue labelling was created.
    This adds more information into what makes an issue labelled as "triaged".
    
    The section on the wiki on prioritization and p1,p2,p3,... labels was move to the labelling section.
    The information here dated, and was not in line with how NV Access was labelling and prioritising.
    We are also proposing new changes to the priority labelling with clearer definition boundaries.
    The current p1-p4 issues will all be downgraded to p2-p5, with the exception of manually reviewed issues, and issues flagged by the community.
    
    Additionally, some grammar and formatting fixes were made

    Fix the wrong rendering format of command line options in userGuide (#15334)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In the Command Line Options section of the user guide, a pair of --s on the line -copy-portable-config resulted in strikethrough rendering in the output HTML.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    All options are `` by backticks.
    
    Description of development approach
    All options are `` by backticks.

    Remove issue template from blank issue template - was not kept in sync (#15328)
    
    GitHub has an issue where even though we disable opening blank issues, they can still be created.
    If a GitHub user reaches the page: https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/new, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md is rendered.
    It is uncertain where this page is linked from, as the preferred and main UX is where you choose an issue https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/new/choose.
    
    An older copy of the issue template is kept in the blank issue template.
    This is not kept in sync with the main bug report issue template.
    It also misses a lot of information from the main bug report issue template.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Remove the duplicate bug report template from the blank issue template.
    Instead encourage using issue templates correctly.

    Migrate contributing wiki to repository (#15329)
    
    NV Access is intending to move most of the wiki into the repository, so changes are tracked better and easier to propose.
    The contributing wiki page is a prime candidate for migration.
    The contributing wiki, and project README are somewhat difficult to navigate and follow.
    As part of a wider goal of making these simpler, migrating them to the repository is a required first step.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The Contributing wiki page was merged back to CONTRIBUTING.md.
    
    https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/Contributing
    A large amount of this wiki page was duplicated in codingStandards.md.
    These sections were merged and updated in codingStandards.md.
    
    Additionally, some grammar and formatting fixes were made

    Interrupt port initialization when there is IOError exception (#15239)
    
    Fixes #15226
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Driver continued port initialization retries although there was IOError exception.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Port initialization is stopped when there is IOError exception.
    
    Description of development approach
    If there is IoError exception, _initPort function returns None which causes _initConnection function to raise RuntimeError. No need to try with 9600 bps, and there is no other port to try.

    Albatross: write timeout change and minor code refactoring (#15269)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Driver used 0 for write_timeout (non-blocking). If display was updated frequently (for example pressing and holding arrow key down in long document), display updating continued some time after for example arrow key was not pressed anymore. Using write_timeout 0.2 seconds (quite typical value with other braille drivers) resolves this.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Braille shows pretty quickly valid information after situations where braille line was updated frequently (for example when pressing and holding arrow key down in long document).
    
    Description of development approach
    In addition to write_timeout change, there is a change how display is updated after reconnection and exit from internal menu. Using braille.handler._displayWithCursor function, driver code can be reduced.

    Fix context menu focus for Edge downloads (#15300)
    
    Fixes #14916
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When opening the context menu from the Edge downloads window, NVDA doesn't reflect this.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Context menu is read again.
    
    Description of development approach
    It looks like the context menu items aren't direct children of the foreground window, therefore we compare the root of the foreground and the root of the focus window instead.
    Fixed a typo in a UIAHandler debug string
    Ensured that UIAHandler.getNearestWindowHandle returns when a cached window handle couldn't be fetched from an UIAElement due to a COMError.

    No longer classify (rich) edit classes as bad for UIA (#15314)
    
    Fixes #14285
    
    Summary of the issue:
    There are reports of NVDA being sluggish in Rich Edit controls. In d5a3383bb2, rich edit classes were classified as bad for UIA for us to always use the win32 implementation. However, our support for UIA text editing is good enough for this restriction to be lifted, as this also solves the reported sluggishness.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Using UIA instead of win32 API's under the hood.
    
    Description of development approach
    Moved the role, value and states overrides to a base class in window.edit
    Rather than simply removing win32 edit classes when using UIA, insert the EditBase class as well. This ensures that role is reported as editable text rather than document, and that the multiline state is added. This ensures backwards compatibility as long as code authors don't match against MSAA specific properties.

    Add support for SysListView32 controls with a native UIA implementation (#15295)
    
    Fixes #15283
    
    Summary of the issue:
    .NET 7 Win Forms has a native implementation for SysListView32 controls. This conflicts with us listing SysListView32 as a bad UIA Class name.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Win forms project in #15283 now works as expected for the most part.
    
    Description of development approach
    Implemented SysListView32 in a new UIA module. Note that UIA seems to expose the following tree by default:
    
    A list object
    Children for the list items having the ListItem control type, but neither GridItem nor TableItem patterns
    Sub items containing both GridItem and TableItem patterns.
    I did the following:
    
    Introduced fetching of children text and column headers, mostly based on the Outlook app module
    Implement position info based on row number of the first child and total row count of parent

    Fix context menu bouncing in Edge browse mode (#15316)
    
    Fixes #15309
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In Edge browse mode, when opening the context menu, NVDA many times goes back to browse mode.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will no correctly focus the context menu opened from Edge browse mode.
    
    Description of development approach
    The issue behind this is as follows. Take a link as example:
    
    Disabling the option Automatically set system focus to focusable elements ensures that an object only gets focus when strictly necessary. This is the case when opening the context menu, because otherwise, the context menu would open for the wrong object.
    When opening the context menu on the link, NVDA calls script_passThrough
    script_passThrough calls setFocus on the link's object and sends the gesture.
    Two focus events are fired, one for the link in the document and one for the context menu
    NVDA first processes the context menu event and after that, the link object event
    Focus bounces from the context menu back to the link.
    There is a very trivial fix for this. With calling api.processPendingEvents, we ensure that NVDA first processes the event generated by setFocus before executing the gesture.

    MS Word object model: Always fetch range information (#15307)
    
    Fixes #15019
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA only fetches object text range information if "report headings" and "report comments and notes" are enabled.
    This only happens when using the object model.
    This causes a crash when attempting to update the caret, as we try to fetch range information that hasn't been generated by nvdaHelper.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix crash in Microsoft Word when Document formatting options "report headings" and "report comments and notes" were not enabled.
    
    Description of development approach
    Always fetch range information, regardless of these options.

commit a198c9b5f27e47ff2830f77c833eec584078dfd8
Author: Sean Budd <sean@nvaccess.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 8 16:35:03 2023 +1000

    Expand Code of Conduct to prohibit inciting violence and proselytising (#15270)
    
    The code of conduct currently prohibits explicitly violent language, but has no statement on inciting violence.
    Inciting, encouraging or otherwise glorifying violence is materially not much different to violence itself.
    Prohibiting inciting violence is a common standard on social media platforms, and is also prohibited on GitHub itself
    
    This PR adds an explicit ban on inciting or glorifying violence to the code of conduct.
    This PR also adds an explicit ban on religious and political proselytising.

    Create helper function to show custom modal dialogs safer (#15265)
    
    Raised in #15246 (comment)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Sometimes a custom modal dialog is required, instead of just using gui.message.messageBox.
    For example, adding additional buttons or controls instead of just message text and ok/cancel/yes/no buttons.
    However gui.message.messageBox adds special handling to ensure users are warned if actions are blocked by an open modal dialog.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Users are warned when trying to perform a task (e.g opening the NVDA menu) when modal dialogs from the add-on store are waiting a response.
    Other modal dialogs have also been addressed, unless they are non-blocking (i.e. started in a separate thread).
    These might be worth addressing too, on a case-by-case basis.
    
    Description of development approach
    Create a helper function to show a dialog as a modal dialog, while performing the necessary handling of messageBox
    
    Testing strategy:
    Test opening various Add-on store dialogs and performing nvda+n

    Add-on store: use separate translation strings for the status filter key (#15266)
    
    Fixes #15258
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The add-on store has 2 sets of strings which are identical, except the inclusion of the an accelerator key.
    The add-on tabs (e.g. "Available add-ons") do not have an accelerator key, as they are navigated with control+tab.
    The add-on list is labelled as "Available &add-ons" so the list can easily be reached with alt+a.
    Previously, NVDA stripped the ampersand, and otherwise used the same translation strings.
    For Chinese, the method of stripping the accelerator key ampersand is not ideal.
    For example, translating "Updatable &add-ons" into Simplified Chinese is "可更新的插件(&A)".
    For the add-on tabs, this becomes "可更新的插件(A)" where it should be "可更新的插件".
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Translation strings are now separate, allowing Chinese translators to translate the strings as "可更新的插件(&A)" and "可更新的插件"
    
    Description of development approach

    User Guide fixes (#15256)
    
    Fix-up of #15065
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Various issues found in documentation while reviewing translation:
    
    Flattened review:
    For example, if you move to the next object in this flattened view and the current object contains other objects, NVDA will automatically move to the first object that contains it.
    Should be "that it contains", not "that contains it"!
    Cc @leonardder for approval
    
    Excel UIA option not at the correct place in the documentation with respect to its position in the GUI's Advanced settings panel.
    
    Searching for add-ons
    
    -Type a keyword or two for the kind of add-on you're looking for, then tab back to the list of add-ons.
    Actually, we tab forward, not back.
    
    Add-on Store spelling: Let's take care to use an unique writing so that people get immediately used:
    So "Add-on Store", not "Add-ons Store".
    
    Key name formatting:
    Key name formatting should always be used for single keys, not for a whole list of keys including separators or parenthesis that do not belong to the name of a key as done for some braille keys.

    Fixes #15257

commit b8efec7292c5ec1aeccb11f1e0b5fa1505ba4727
Author: Sean Budd <sean@nvaccess.org>

    Add-on store: add warning dialog (#15246)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Users should be informed of the risk of installing add-ons
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When opening the add-on store, a warning dialog is shown.
    There is a checkbox to not show the warning again.
    
    Description of development approach
    Uses similar approach to the user stats dialog
    Move banner creation to helper function
    
    Added typing to guiHelper.BoxSizerHelper. Fix bug where if a StaticBoxSizer is used with an intflag of buttons, BoxSizerHelper.addDialogDismissButtons wouldn't work correctly
    
    Add support for creating labelled checkboxes using the BoxSizerHelper, LabelledControlHelper and associateElements
    
    Testing strategy:
    Test banner using --disable-addons
    Test with sample code in source code for addDialogDismissButtons bug.
    Test the warning nag - ensure the checkbox to hide the warning works

    Add-on store: handle description from manifest is None (#15245)
    
    None
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The description fields in the manifest are optional, and default to None.
    This is not handled by the add-on models correctly, which expect the description field to always be a string
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Add-ons without descriptions can be correctly viewed in the add-on store
    
    Description of development approach
    return an empty string if there is no description for the add-on.

    Always use utf-8 for addon store caches (#15241)
    
    Closes #15231
    
    Summary of the issue:
    If NVDA language is set to Serbian, the cache could get corrupted while reading or writing do to the encoding not specified while opening the file.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA add-on store works with Serbian. Also, If the cached installed addon data is invalid, the exception will be logged similar to the add-on store cache, instead of preventing the add-on store from launching.
    
    Description of development approach
    open all files in _addonStore\dataManager.py in utf-8.
    If the file is unable to be opened, or json.load fails, the exception will be logged.
    Testing strategy:
    Installed multiple add-ons, with Serbian translation and without, while NVDA's language is set to Serbian.

    Revert "Improve shortcut key reporting (#14900)" (#15237)
    
    Fixes #15233
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Unfortunately pr #14900 causes Code Factory Eloquence to spell out menu items with shortcut keys, such as in the NVDA menu.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Menu items are no longer spelled out when focusing menu items when using the Code Factory Eloquence driver.
    
    Description of development approach
    Although the bug is technically in the Code Factory driver I think - not handlin character mode command correctly when embedded in other speech,
    PR 14900 is the first known case that exercises the bug directly.
    Because 2023.2 is not an add-on breaking release, we are reverting pr #14900.
    A replacement pr for 2023.3 can be opened that avoids affecting Code Factory Eloquence if at all possible, or a new copy of the reverted pr can be opened for NVDA 2024.1.

    Ensure tabbing through a message in Windows Mail does not get stuck on the same link. (#15234)
    
    Fixes #15211
    
    Summary of the issue:
    After merging of pr #14611, tabbing through a message in Windows Mail would cause the caret / focus to get stuck and not move forward to the next element in tab order.
    This seems to be because BrowseModeDocument's gainFocus event updates the caret to the position of the element in the document that just gained focus. This is appropriate for web documents where NVDA manages the caret itself, but not for documents where the caret is managed by the application, such as the MS Word mail message viewer.
    This has most likely been a problem in some way for a long time, but pr #14611 made it much more obvious as it greatly increased the amount of focus events within documents now spoken / handled.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA no longer gets stuck when tabbing through a message in Windows Mail.
    
    Description of development approach
    Suppressing of caret movement in BrowseModeDocument's gainFocus event is controled by a new private variable on the CursorManager class. It is False by default, which does not allow the caret movement to occur. However, for ReviewCursorManager and VirtualBuffer classes, it is True, allowing the existing caret movement behaviour, as in these situations the caret is managed entirely by NVDA.
    This then means that in the cases where a CursorManager is used that is not VirtualBuffer or ReviewCursorManager, which is just Microsoft Word browse mode, NVDA will not move the caret itself on gainFocus events, as the application itself will already do this.

    Fix braille extension points not properly unregistered for braille viewer (#15214)
    
    Fixes regression from #14503
    
    Summary of the issue:
    As part of #14503, braille extension points have been added that are used by the braille viewer. However when destroying the braille viewer by pressing alt+f4, the display size filter handler was never unregistered, resulting in the braille handler still assuming 40 braille cells even though no display was connected.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Braille handler connectly restores to 0 cells again after disabling the braille viewer with alt+f4 when no braille display is connected.
    
    Description of development approach
    Changed if check on the dialog to is not None explicitly. wx gives a destroyed window a bool value of False, so the boolean check would work.
    Ensure braille.filter_displaySize is unregistered when destroyBrailleViewer is called when the window is already destroyed. Note that destroying the window will unregister braille.pre_writeCells properly, so that unregistration can be limited to an undestroyed window only.

    Add-on store: Fix handling of external add-ons (#15223)
    
    Fixes #15218
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Add-ons which were being installed from an external source were treated like an installed add-on.
    This resulted in trying to get manifest information for the installed add-ons collection, rather than the bundle that the install is coming from.
    When trying to install an incompatible add-on from an external source, an error is raised, as manifest data is not fetched correctly.
    This prevents the confirmation dialog from appearing and prevents the user from installing incompatible add-ons from external sources.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Add-ons which are incompatible can be installed from an external source.
    
    Description of development approach
    Instead, use the manifest data from the external add-on bundle.

    Fixup 'Temporary Copy restrictions' in the user guide (#15222)
    
    #13985 introduced new restrictions for temporary copies of NVDA, preventing the add-on store from opening and preventing writing to disk.
    These should be explained in the user guide
    
    Description of user facing changes
    N/A
    
    Description of development approach
    Simplified some of the structure in the user guide, including explaining what a temporary copy is.

    Fixup #14924: again use weak references for functions (#15215)
    
    Fixup of #14924
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #14627, we introduced weak references for APCs called as part of a waitable timer. In #14924, this was made more robust by using a single internal APC func. However in the porting process, a part of the logic was reversed, therefore in the internal APC store, we still stored strong rather than weak references.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    Store references instead of functions in the apc store.

    braille.handler.setDisplayByName: fix logic error. (#15207)
    
    Addresses issue introduced by pr #14524
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Reports from users that if a specifically configured braille display cannot be initialized on start-up, then the Braille category in the NVDA settings dialog is broken and does not show a valid braille driver (noBraille or otherwise).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The Braille category in NVDA settings will continue to be usable if the configured Braille display cannot be initialized on start-up.
    
    Description of development approach
    In braille.handler.setDisplayByName if setting the display failed, the display is not set to NoBraille if the display was (not) already NoBraille. Previously this logic was incorrectly reversed.

    Restore numpad gestures for move in flatten view of object hierarchy commands for all keyboard layouts (#15191)
    
    Closes #15185
    Follow-up of #15065.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    New gestures to move in flattened object hierarchy have been added in #15065: nvda+numpad3/9 for desktop layout and shift+NVDA+[ / ] for laptop layout.
    
    Although mainly used with desktop layout, object nav-related gestures associated to numpad are usually bound to all keyboard layout (desktop and laptop). This allows for example users to have NVDA to be configured with laptop layout for a laptop computer without numpad on its keyboard, but to use the numpad gestures in case an external keyboard with numpad is plugged in.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The gestures NVDA+numpad3/9 for the new flattened object navigation commands will now be available both in laptop and in desktop mode.
    
    As done for other obj nav gestures, the user guide (and the change log) still advertises numpad gestures for desktop layout only.
    
    Description of development approach
    Changed the gesture definition.

    Add-on store: Fix up loading message (#15186)
    
    Fixes #14975
    Fixes #15184
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Sometimes the add-on store incorrectly reports "Loading add-ons" when it should report "No add-on selected".
    This happens when no add-ons are found. When an add-on is found, the text is correctly replaced with the add-ons name.
    
    When switching tabs, the add-on search filter should be reset.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix bug where "No add-on selected" should be reported instead of "loading add-ons".
    
    When switching tabs, the add-on search filter is now reset.
    
    Description of development approach
    Notify the details panel to update when the add-on list loading is complete. Previously, this would only refresh when an add-on was found.

    Changes to handle #15150
    Follow up to #14697, #14896, #15038, #15097, #15145
    
    Summary of the issue:
    WASAPI usage is known to cause intermittent crashing in #15150.
    Generally, WASAPI code has not been proven to be stable.
    Due to this, it should not be enabled by default in 2023.2.
    WASAPI can be re-enabled by default once it is proven to be stable.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Disable WASAPI by default, preventing intermittent crashing #15150
    
    Description of development approach
    Turn the WASAPI checkbox into a feature flag, so that it can easily be re-enabled in future.
    
    Testing strategy:
    Manual testing
    Upgrading the profile: Test starting NVDA with the WASAPI config value set to "True/False" instead of a "enabled/disabled/default".
    
    Test the various controls related to WASAPI - ensure they are saved, applied and respected correctly.

    Add option for ignoring blank lines for report line indentation (#15057)
    
    closes #13394
    
    Summary of the issue:
    As elaborated in #13394, line indentation reporting can be too noisy in contexts where indentation changes for blank lines aren't meaningful and distract from the actually meaningful indentation changes, such as is the case when reading source code for Python and many other programming languages.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    A new checkbox is added to Document formatting, "Ignore blank lines for line indentation reporting". By default it is off, in which case line indentation reporting behaves as it does currently. If the user ticks the checkbox, then indentation changes are not reported for blank lines.
    
    There is also a new unassigned global command for toggling the setting.
    
    Description of development approach
    new config property: ignoreBlankLinesForRLI = boolean(default=false)
    short for ignoreBlankLinesForReportLineIndentation, which was too long and causing Flake8 issues
    new settings panel checkbox for toggling ignoreBlankLinesForRLI
    in speech.speech.getTextInfoSpeech, if ignoreBlankLinesForRLI is true and the line is blank, the block of code that inserts the indentation announcement and updates the indentation cache is skipped, otherwise it behaves as usual
    user guide updated with brief info on new option
    added unassigned global command for toggling ignoreBlankLinesForRLI
    added system test for confirming the correct behavior

    Add-on store: Fix translations for add-ons installed from add-on store (#15152)
    
    Closes #14973
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Add-ons installed from the add-on store used the untranslated add-on store JSON strings.
    As of #15137, only add-ons that were installed from an external source had translated strings.
    
    Description of user facing changes

    Description of development approach
    Create a separate model for add-ons fetched from the add-on store, and add-ons cached after being installed from the add-on store.
    Data fetched from the add-on store should be translated. Installed cached data for an add-on will be whatever language is used when the fetched add-on store data is cached. As such, we should defer to the translated manifests for installed add-ons.

    Fix issues with script propagation in Excel as well as tree interceptor passthrough on init (#15136)
    
    Fixes #15131
    Fixes #10612
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Recent changes to Excel support caused an issue where selection in the Excel cell edit control didn't work. When fixing that, I discovered another issue where initializing the Excel tree interceptor set the passThrough auto property to True, resulting into vision and braille focus set to the previous focus object.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Selection works again in cell edit controls
    When leaving a cell edit control, the name of the sheet is announced again, similar when coming from the formula bar.
    When an excel cell gets focus from outside, focus is no longer needlessly set to the previous focus object.
    Description of development approach
    This is another case of an issue that was obfuscated before #14984. There is a workaround in the Excel appModule to fallback on the UIA edit control if the edit control that gets focus when pressing f2 reports as unknown. However, the parent of the UIA control was set to the excel cell, not to the parent of the Excel6 window. This means that the changeSelection script still propagated, i.e. for every selection change related gesture in the cell edit control, NVDA would check whether a new cell was focused.
    I changed the app module to set the parent of the UIA cell edit to the parent of the Excel6 window. This has the side effect of the sheet name being reported after leaving the edit control because the sheet receives focus again. This is however consistent with behavior prior to the app module workaround was applied, i.e. the time when we relied on the displayText to report the contents.
    After I applied this change, I discovered that leaving the edit cell raised a COMError on an UIA object. This turned out to be an issue like this:
    
    api.setFocusObject was called for the new focus object (i.e. the worksheet)
    A new tree interceptor was created for the work sheet
    In the init method of the tree interceptor, self.passThrough was set, which is an auto property calling _set_passThrough on the tree interceptor.
    _set_passThrough called braille.handler.handleGainFocus and vision.handler.handleGainFocus for the current focus object, which was still the previous focus object (i.e. api.setFocusObject was not yet updated to the new focus).
    a COMError was raised because the UIA cell edit element was no longer available.
    I fixed this by setting _passThrough instead, which sets the internal _passThrough boolean without applying the logic that updates focus for vision and braille, which is really not necessary and even harmful to do in init of a tree interceptor. I therefore applied the same change to another incarnation of this issue in the MSHTML virtual buffer.

    Gracefully ignore NVDANotInitializedError when scheduling WASAPI idle check. (#15145)
    
    Fixes #15143.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When playing the start sound, NVDA can fail with this error:
    
      File "nvwave.pyc", line 975, in _scheduleIdleCheck
      File "core.pyc", line 928, in callLater
    core.NVDANotInitializedError: Cannot schedule callable, wx.App is not initialized
    Description of user facing changes
    Fixed the error.
    
    Description of development approach
    Feeding WASAPI audio schedules an idle check, which uses core.callLater. That will fail if the wx.App isn't initialised yet.
    
    We now just catch this and ignore it. playWaveFile closes the stream after playing anyway, so this first idle check isn't important.

    Make gui.MainFrame.popupSettingsDialog part of the public API (#15121)
    
    Fixes #15096
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When an active profile has the synthesizer set to silence, and a user switches profiles to a synthesizer which fails to load, NVDA fails back to the silence synthesizer.
    
    This is because the default behaviour on failure is to roll back to the previous synthesizer, which is appropriate except for silence.
    
    As this is an attempt to change from silence to speech, instead NVDA should fallback to the next synthesizer, rather than the previous synthesizer.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA falls back to the silence synthesizer when:
    
    a user is using the silence synthesizer,
    and attempts to switch synthesizers e.g. via a profile change
    and the synthesizer fails to load
    Description of development approach
    ensure the previous synthesizer we are switching back to is not silence.
    Instead, the synth will switch to the next one, which may eventually reach silence if subsequent synthesizers fail to load.

    Add-on store: support localisation for installed add-ons (#15137)
    
    Part of #14973
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Installed add-ons do not have their display name and description localised, even if localised manifests exist for the installed add-on.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Reinstate localisation for installed add-ons of the display name and description
    
    Description of development approach
    Fetch translated strings from the localised manifests
    
    Testing strategy:
    Ensure add-on with localisations is correctly displayed in the installed add-ons tab of the store.
    Available and updatable add-ons rely on the strings to be translated when fetching from the store.

    Stop WASAPI streams if they've been inactive for more than a minute. (#15097)
    
    Fixes #14913.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    On some systems, when WASAPI is enabled, the system won't automatically go to sleep, even though it goes to sleep fine when WASAPI is disabled.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When WASAPI audio is enabled, the computer now automatically goes to sleep if appropriate.
    
    Description of development approach
    When a WASAPI stream isn't stopped, this unfortunately prevents some systems from going to sleep automatically. I think this is on Windows 10 and earlier, but the precise details aren't clear. According to a Microsoft engineer, this is by design.
    
    I originally thought this occurred when a WASAPI stream remained open. However, some testing revealed that stopping the stream seems to be enough to fix this. Previously, we didn't explicitly stop idle streams. Stopping is better than closing because opening a stream after it is closed can introduce delays or truncated audio.
    
    Specific implementation details:
    
    Add a method to stop a WASAPI stream when it is idle.
    When feed() is called, track the current time as the last time the stream was definitely active. If there isn't a pending stream idle check, schedule one.
    Every 5 seconds, check if there are any playing streams that haven't been active for 10 seconds. If there are any, stop them.
    We use a class-wide check to avoid continually resetting timers on every audio chunk. See the docstring for WasapiWavePlayer._idleCheck for details.

    Add-on store: fix various upgrading bugs (#15132)
    
    Fixes #14991
    
    Summary of the issue:
    There are various bugs with updating add-ons
    
    An externally sourced add-on replacing an add-on store add-on does not correctly flush the add-on store version JSON cache. This causes the outdated add-on version information to be used by the externally installed add-on.
    Updating an add-on through via the store does not correctly reflect the state: this allows an add-on to be updated multiple times. Instead the "download, pending install" state must be tracked better.
    Updating an add-on externally does not correctly reflect the state: instead "pending removal" is shown, instead of pending install.
    Updating an add-on externally is not handled correctly, causing the updated add-on to never be installed correctly
    Updating an add-on through the store is not handled correctly, the new bundle should be installed before the previous bundle is marked for removal. This allows the add-on to run install/uninstall tasks in an expected way
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix various bugs with updating an add-on
    
    Description of development approach
    match the addonHandler installation / removal order when updating an add-on through the add-on store
    check download status when determining state
    Reflect "pending install" rather than "pending removal" for add-ons being updated.
    include downloaded, pending installs in the installed add-ons tab
    ensure add-ons are detected correctly when removing pending installs

    Fix first SAPI5 utterance after 10 seconds of silence is missed (#15129)
    
    Fixes #15082
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The first utterance after around 10 seconds of silence with a SAPI5 synth is not spoken.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Issue does no longer occur.
    
    Description of development approach
    Since #14759 we are modifying some window messages in our process. This includes setting the SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG flag. I was able to pinpoint that setting this flag to a message of type WM_APP caused this particular issue with SAPI5. Therefore I excluded this range of messages (WM_APP through 0xBFFF).

    Move the system caret when routing review cursor (#15064)
    
    Fixes #14885
    Fixes #3166
    
    Summary of the issue:
    It has not been possible to move system focus/caret with single routing button press when braille is tethered to review, or when braille is tethered to automatically and follows temporarily review cursor. When user wants to review editable text without affecting system caret position (braille tethered to review continuously or temporarily), it maybe useful if he/she can route caret when needed for example to correct typos. Although thiskinds of routing has been possible, it has required at least one extra routing button press.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    A new setting Move system caret when Routing review cursor is added:
    
    Never (Default): No change
    Only when tethered automatically: Routing keys will move the caret or focus when tethered automatically. When explicitly tethered to review, routing keys won't move the caret
    Always: Regardless whether tethered to review or automatically, routing the review cursor will move the caret or focus
    Description of development approach
    This pr takes a different approach to #15044.
    
    The logic is not in the routing scripts in globalCommands but instead on the braille.ReviewTextInfoRegion class as well as two new region types for review cursor and objects. First of all, TextInfoRegion.routeTo has been split into two methods. This ensures that we can override the routing behavior for the review cursor regions without touching the BrailleInput logic. Furthermore, the following changes were added/changed:
    
    ReviewNVDAObjectRegion: simply sets focus to the object before executing the default action
    ReviewCursorManagerRegion. Inherrits from ReviewTextInfoRegion and CursorManagerRegion to ensure that ReviewTextInfoRegion._routeToTextInfo calls the right super class on cursor managers
    ReviewTextInfoRegion: implemented _routeToTextInfo to support the new behavior. It always calls the super class to execute the normal routing action (i.e. moving the review cursor and activating the position). When routing should move the system caret, it calls setFocus on an object when the underlying TextInfo class is DisplayModel, i.e. when in screen review. Otherwise, it calls setCursor on the super class, which translates to moving the system or cursor manager caret.

    Add-on Store: prevent duplicate instances from opening (#15105)
    
    Closes #15041
    
    Summary of the issue:
    A reference to the add-on store is kept alive after being destroyed.
    It is unclear what is causing this.
    If a reference is kept alive, handling a new instance causes an error, allowing multiple instances of the add-on store dialog to be opened.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Prevent multiple instances of the add-on store dialog from opening.
    Suppress the ERROR level log when an instance is kept alive to debugWarning, and instead handle the "dead" instance more gracefully.
    
    Description of development approach
    Improve the initialisation and destruction of the add-on store with the goal of reducing references to the add-on store dialog from being held.
    This is not effective at preventing the add-on store dialog reference from staying alive, but may help solve the problem in future.
    It is unclear how the dialog instance is remaining alive, and where the reference is being held.
    
    If an instance is being kept alive, instead of throwing an error when starting a new instance, mark the instance as alive and re-use the alive instance.

    Fix Excel cell formatting reporting (#15100)
    
    Fixes #15091
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Pr #14984 broke Excel cell formatting reporting in such a way that it would always report all formatting, regardless of whether the formatting changed between cells.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Ensure that cell formatting isn't repeated needlessly.
    
    Description of development approach
    When getting the selection in script_changeSelection, override the parent of the selection with self. This ensures that the format field cache on the work sheet will persist when moving through cells.

    Create registry key to force secure mode (#15049)
    
    Fixes #10018
    
    Summary of the issue:
    System administrators may wish to configure NVDA to restrict unauthorized system access.
    Secure mode can be forced through the --secure CLI parameter, however, forcing this parameter is not easily done for system administrators.
    
    In a corporate environment where application usage is restricted, NVDA should be forced into secure mode via a registry key parameter, rather than a CLI parameter
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Added a registry key parameter to force secure mode of NVDA.
    
    Improved documentation for system administrators on secure mode.

    Make add-on store accelerator keys label translatable and discoverable (#15103)
    
    Closes #15010
    Closes #15011
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In add-on store, some accelerator keys are not discoverable nor translatable:
    
    alt+L for the add-on list is hard-coded (thus not modifiable by translators) and is not discoverable, neither visually (no visible label), nor via object navigation on the whole list
    alt+O for "Other details" field is not discoverable visually nor with shift+numpad2.
    Description of user facing changes
    The labels for the list and for "other details" field are made visible and the accelerator key is underlined.
    shift+numpad2 allows to report the accelerator key of the field.
    Description of development approach
    Do not hide anymore the labels of the list and "other details" field
    used the same strings for the label of the list and of the tabs; the only difference is that the "&" making a letter an accelerator key is removed when the string is used for the tabs (and for the title).
    Used "alt+c" for the "Actions" button to free up "alt+a" for the add-on list label.
    Testing strategy:
    For "Other details" and for the 4 possible labels of the add-on list:
    
    Visual check
    Check that alt+a/alt+o are working, i.e. moving the focus
    When tabbing to "Other details" or to empty add-on list, checked that alt+O/alt+A is reported
    When in "Other details" or in empty add-on list, shift+numpad2 reports the shortcut key
    When moving nav object to the add-on list (not specifically empty), the shortcut key is reported.

    Add-on store: Improve refreshing the cache (#15071)
    
    Fixes #15034
    Fixes #15077
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The store data cache is refreshed every 6 hours. This may not be enough and it's desirable to add a mechanism to refresh it making a small request to the server, so we can request data just when a new commit has been done to the views branch of the nvaccess/addon-datastore repo.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When opening the add-on store, if there has been changes on the server, the cached data should be updated.
    
    Description of development approach
    In dataManager, a function has been added to get the cacheHash from NV Access server.
    References to date, including parameters of functions, have been replaced with variables which hold the value of the cache hash.
    try... except clauses have been used to ensure that .json files which store cache data are valid,though perhaps a jsonschema will be more robust and will allow to control data types.
    network.py has been tweaked.

    soffice: Don't announce previous cell coordinates (as selection) (#15099)
    
    Fixes #15098
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When announcement of cell coordinates is disabled in NVDA settings, moving focus in a Calc spreadsheet resulted in the coordinates of the previously focused cell to be announced.
    This is caused by Libreoffice sending an EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONREMOVE event on the previously focused cell before sending an EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS event for the newly focused cell
    (s. https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/refs/heads/master/sc/source/ui/Accessibility/AccessibleSpreadsheet.cxx#588 ). This triggered announcement of the previously focused cell in the LibreOffice app module handling for cell selection changes.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No more announcement of the previosly focused cell when switching focus to another one in LibreOffice Calc and announcement of cell coordinates is disabled in NVDA settings.
    
    Description of development approach
    In the LibreOffice app module specific code that handles EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONREMOVE and EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONADD for table cells, only trigger announcement of the selection (or currently focused cell) if a selection actually exists, i.e. the number of selected cells is positive. (Announcement of a focused cell when no selection exists still happens in response to the corresponding event indicating focus change.)

    Output ARIA live regions in Braille (#15078)
    
    Closes #7756.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA does not output ARIA live regions in Braille, making them completely inaccessible in Braille-only usage scenarios.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    ARIA live region updates are now displayed as Braille messages, similarly to UIA notification events.
    
    Description of development approach
    Call brailleHandler.message on live region updates.

    Link to issue number:
    Fixes #15053
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Object navigation can be difficult to grasp for some people. It is helpful to assign the flattened object nav gestures (that are now only available on touch screen)by default.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    See change log items
    
    Description of development approach
    Added gestures to scripts in globalCommands.

    Fixes #14760
    Fixup of #14133
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When saving a config spec, validation would be skipped if the string value of the data is unchanged.
    
    This caused various issues including config values not being correctly converted to numbers from strings when validating.
    This caused config profiles to fail to load or save correctly.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix up of various bugs related to user config
    
    Description of development approach

    Fix context help in Add-on Store (#15080)
    
    Calling context help in the add-on store while the focus is in "Other details" or on the tabs does not jump to the add-on store paragraph.
    Context help on other GUI controls (add-ons list, action button) is not impacted by this issue since they have dedicated help targets.
    Description of user facing changes
    Context help works correctly in add-on store, i.e. jumps to the correct paragraph.
    
    Description of development approach
    Fix the anchor's name according to what is in the user guide.
    
    Testing strategy:
    Tested F1 with a portable version created from the snapshot generated by appVeyor (nvda_snapshot_pr15080-28549,7e72e668.exe) when the focus is in tabs, description field or other details.

    More robust detection of language code with no description (#15031)
    
    Closes #15017 (work-around)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    On a specific system (see #15017), Windows cannot get the language name from LCID. This cause an uncaught error preventing the OCR settings panel to be fully created (and the previous panel to be cleared).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Displaying the OCR settings will not fail anymore on some systems where it is not possible to derive the language name from LCID.
    
    Description of development approach
    When listing OCR languages, we use languageHandler.getLanguageDescription to determine the name given the language code. However this function may return None in case it cannot find a language name.
    This return value had not been taken into account when listing the OCR languages.
    
    Thus this PR allows to add the language code instead of is name in the OCR list as a fallback if the name cannot be found.
    
    A debugWarning is logged in the function languageHandler.getLanguageDescription if the language cannot be found; note that this function is used in some add-ons.
    
    In the settings panel instead, I log an error so that the situations with unknown languages can be captured more easily.

    Fixes #15075
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Highlight has not been reported when querying formatting manually via script in globalCommands, particularly useful after pr #14610.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    If a text is highlighted in Word, now it's reported with NVDA+f, even if highlight reporting is disabled in document formatting settings.
    
    Description of development approach
    Simply added "reportHighlight" as config key to query in _reportFormattingHelper, inside globalCommans.py.

    Fix up speechDictVars deprecation (#15048)
    
    Follow up of #15021
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The deprecation was incorrectly documented, missing the module name and referring to NVDAState.WritePaths.speechDictsDir instead of WritePaths.speechDictsDir.
    
    The change also caused some issues for add-ons who were relying on the deprecated code being imported into a different module.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    N/A
    
    Description of development approach
    For ease of use, compatibility for the imported code has been retained, despite not being an API breaking change.
    
    Documentation of the deprecation has been fixed.

    Add-on store - Clarify window title and list label (#15054)
    
    Fixes #15042
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The title of add-on store window is formatted such as "Add-on Store - All Installed add-ons"
    After the dash, the string is a concatenation of the channel and the type of add-ons in the list.
    
    In English,it makes something almost grammatically correct to build a single expression (if we ignore case). But in other languages, this concatenation without any separator may produce stranger results that sound bad.
    Also, it has been noted that the type of add-on listed ("Available add-ons" in this example) is much more important than the channel; thus it should come first.
    Description of user facing changes
    Reworked the window title to create a title such as "Add-on Store - Installed add-ons (All)"
    While at it, also removed the channel in the list name as pointed in Modify the add-on store title bar text #15042 (comment), that is, the list's name is now "Available add-ons" instead of "All Available add-ons" so that the list name is less verbose.
    Description of development approach
    Implemented changes described below.
    
    Note: I have used parenthesis for the channel, but I may have used a second dash as a separator instead, i.e. "Add-on store - Available add-ons - All". Let me know if you prefer this second version.

    Allow the volume of NVDA sounds to be set within NVDA. (#15038)
    
    Better solution for #1409. Addresses #14896 (comment). Also addresses feedback I received on Mastodon regarding the NVDA sounds volume not appearing in the Windows Volume Mixer in some versions of Windows.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In Support for audio output using WASAPI #14697, I split NVDA speech and sounds into two separate Windows audio sessions to allow independent control of their levels. However, some users want these levels to be linked.
    In Add setting to have the volume of NVDA sounds follow the voice volume. #14896, I made it possible to have the sounds volume follow the voice volume. However, as per Add setting to have the volume of NVDA sounds follow the voice volume. #14896 (comment), some synths don't set the volume in a linear way, so the volumes don't match.
    It was reported to me on Mastodon that in Windows 11 Insider builds, the "NVDA sounds" volume doesn't show up in the Windows Volume Mixer unless you actively play a sound while the Volume Mixer is running. This is not very intuitive, and if this is behaviour Microsoft intends to keep, it isn't going to work well for our users.
    Having the volume of NVDA sounds controlled outside of NVDA is a little cumbersome.
    Description of user facing changes
    There will now only be one entry for NVDA in the Windows Volume Mixer which will control all NVDA audio.
    There will be a slider in NVDA Advanced Settings to control the volume of sounds.
    Description of development approach
    Removed the ability to set a WASAPI session and volume.
    Added a method to set the volume of a stream. This also allows you to set the volume of individual channels, though that's not used yet.
    Added a slider in Advanced Settings to control the volume of NVDA sounds. This is disabled if the sound volume is following the voice volume.

    Browse mode: Elements List dialog: Delay applying filter for smoother response (#10308)
    
    Related to #7197, but does not solve it.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In browse mode, in the Elements List dialog, speed typing a filter string leads to slow responsiveness from the UI and NVDA itself.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    lightly delay the refresh of the elements list by 300 ms. (same technique as PR #10307)

    Add-on store: fix download pending install status loss (#14992)
    
    Fixes #14978
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Downloading and installing an add-on follows these steps:
    
    Download and install is triggered by the user
    Download begins and writes to addonStore/_dl/addonId.download
    Download completes, and the file is renamed and cached addonStore/_dl/addonId-1.23.nvda-addon
    i. if you change tab here, the add-on state can be lost
    User exits NVDA add-on store
    Add-on installation is triggered, add-on is unzipped and written to addons/addonId.pendingInstall
    User is prompted to restart
    On restart addons/addonId.pendingInstall is installed to addons/addonId
    When changing tabs before exiting the add-on store, the state "download pending install" is lost.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When changing tabs before exiting the add-on store, the state "download pending install" is no longer lost.
    
    Description of development approach
    The pending install state check was updated for the add-on store add-on model to include checks for download state.
    Add-ons that are downloaded pending install should now be treated as if they are pending install.
    
    The add-on state determiner now returns the correct state for add-ons which are downloaded but yet to start the install process.

    Encapsulate NVDA state write paths (#15021)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA uses a variety of paths to write to.
    These can be hard to discover or track in the code, as write paths are not stored in globally available named symbols.
    For example, if a developer wishes to find code instances where NVDA writes to the profile config directory, searching "profile" will yield additional results, e.g. code comments.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    N/A
    
    Description of development approach
    Created a centralised class to list all available write paths in NVDA.
    This improves discoverability of write paths.

    Add-on store: fix UX when using high contrast themes (#15026)
    
    Fixes #15007
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA sets the background colour for the details panel explicitly as white, and the text of the details explicitly as black.
    This causes text to be hard to read during high contrast mode.
    When high contrast mode is activated the background of text controls are correctly set to black, but the text color is also black.
    Additionally, the details background is set to white, instead of black, like the text controls.
    Instead, we should infer the background colour to match contrast modes.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    High contrast themes works as expected for the add-on store dialog.
    
    Description of development approach
    Use the BG colour of text controls to set the background colour of the details panel.
    Additionally, remove the code which makes the text explicitly black.

    Plural forms support for translatable strings (#15013)
    
    This PR is the first step to reintroduce the distinction of singulare/plural forms when formatting UI strings. The project is as follow:
    1. This PR introduce three strings to be able to test the feature.
    2. 2023.2 beta phase should be used to validate more widely the feature with translators
    3. A second PR during 2023.3 dev cycle will implement the plural forms for all UI strings containing only one value to format them.
    4. A third PR should implement more complex cases of string formatted by two or more values, e.g. such as "table with x rows and y columns".
    
    This step-by-step approach should allow to lose less work in case an issue occurs and requires to revert changes.
    
    ### Link to issue number:
    First step to implement #12445.
    Restoring #11598, #12432 and #12435 that were reverted in #12448.
    Unblocked by https://github.com/nvaccess/mrconfig/pull/97.
    ### Summary of the issue:
    Some UI messages or strings are reported with plural form, no matter the number passed as parameter to format them, e.g. NVDA reports "list with 1 items" with "s" even if there is only one item.
    
    ### Description of user facing changes
    The following strings will be reported using singular or plural form depending on the number used to format them:
    * "with %s items" (used to describe the number of items in a list on the web)
    * ".1f lines" (used when reporting multiple line spacing formatting in MS Word)
    * ""categories {categories}" used to report categories of appointments in MS Outlook
    
    Translators will be able to translate singular or plural forms.
    
    ### Description of development approach
    * First revert #12448 to restore the first attempt that was made to introduce `ngettext`.
    * Develop a custom `npgettext` function the same way as `pgettext` was introduced in NVDA since `npgettext` is not available in Python 3.7; `pgettext` and `npgettext` are available natively in Python 3.8.
    * `ngettext` and `npgettext` are made accessible without importing them; `pgettext` was already added previously in builtins.
    * Implement the plural form for two strings that are more commonly used than Outlook appointments category reporting:
      * "with %s items", using `ngettext`
      * "%.1f lines", using `npgettext`

    Return "blank" if text empty due to processing (#13483)
    
    closes #13431
    
    After processing a text for dictionary substitutions and symbol level, the result might be an empty string, which leads to nothing being spoken at all (not even "blank"). Something should always be spoken when reading text, since nothing being spoken gives the appearance of NVDA freezing.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    When a speech sequence is submitted to speech.speak, if all strings of the sequence become empty due to symbol level and dictionary substitution processing, then the sequence is considered blank and "blank" is appended to it.
    
    The function now also takes an additional argument, suppressBlanks, which is false by default. This parameter allows callers to suppress the "blank" being appended to the sequence, even if the conditions are met. The main intention is to suppress this behavior during say all. Usages of speech.speak have been updated to specify this parameter when appropriate.

    Add-on Store: use Yes/No buttons with incompatibility question dialogs, instead of OK/Cancel buttons; improve related translator comments (#15015)
    
    Fixes #15000
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Dialogs used when installing, enabling, or upgrading to, incompatible add-ons, asked yes or no questions to the user.
    However, such dialogs used OK and Cancel as their buttons, which didn't really make sense.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    These three dialogs now have Yes and No buttons.
    
    Incidentally, added a newline before the question in each dialog, as commented in the original issue. This can be reverted separately if undesirable.
    
    Description of development approach
    Replaced the ErrorAddonInstallDialogWithCancelButton class, with a new class called ErrorAddonInstallDialogWithYesNoButtons.
    Removed ErrorAddonInstallDialogWithCancelButton, since it wasn't used anywhere other than for these three dialogs in gui/_addonStoreGui/controls/messageDialogs.py.
    Added a newline to separate explanation from actual question in these dialogs.
    Enhanced (hopefully) some translator comments I noticed along the way, as follow:
    Created a more accurate translator comment for the incomparable version during update message.
    Made the translator comment less ambiguous, for the message used when an add-on is being installed but is too old to be compatible.
    Made the translator comment more accurate, for the message used when enabling an add-on too old to be compatible.
    Fixed a typo in another translator comment.

    Add space between add-on list and External install button in the add-on store GUI (#15009)
    
    Fixes #15008
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In the add-on store GUI, the add-on list and the "Install from external source" button are too close to each other.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    There is now more space between the add-ons list and the button.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added a spacer between the two controls in the sizer. I have use the hard-coded value 5 as done elsewhere in this dialog.

    Add setting to have the volume of NVDA sounds follow the voice volume. (#14896)
    
    Fixes #1409.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Users would like to be able to control the volume of NVDA sounds. With the WASAPI implementation in #14697, it is possible to separately control the volume of NVDA sounds using the Windows Volume Mixer. However, it is often useful to link the volume of NVDA sounds to the volume of the voice.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    It is now possible to have the volume of NVDA sounds and beeps follow the volume setting of the voice you are using. This option can be enabled in Advanced settings.
    
    Description of development approach
    When this option is enabled and a WasapiWavePlayer is using soundsSession, the open() and stop() methods of WasapiWavePlayer set the session volume to the synth's voice volume. Note that we do this in stop() because some players keep the device open; e.g. tones.

    when searching for text, "not found" message style changed from ERROR to INFORMATION (#14807)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When the Searching for text function does not find the text, NVDA shows a MessageBox.
    Now the style of this MessageBox is ERROR. This pull request changes the style of this MessageBox to INFORMATION.
    This message is literally not an error. This is information.
    
    This change is proposed with the following considerations in mind:
    
    Messages with the ERROR style have a recognizable appearance and are accompanied by a system error sound. For users, such messages carry negative associations and cause unpleasant emotions. It seems that there is no need to scare users with an ERROR style message in cases of text not found, because this situation is not comparable to situations of real errors in the system.
    Other Windows applications do not use ERROR style messages in similar situations. For example, the standard Notepad application shows information about unfound text using messages in the INFORMATION style, and not ERROR. That is, this pull request brings NVDA closer to the unified Windows interface language.
    Description of user facing changes
    Message is displayed as information not error
    
    Description of development approach
    Changed message style, lint, add translator comments

    Fix on the panel's name in the multi-category settings dialog (#14996)
    
    Issue similar to #14607.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In the multi-category settings dialog, the panel takes the name of the corresponding category. This name is reported when tabbing from the category list to the panel. If the category name contains an ampersand, this character is not reported in the panel's name and it acts as an accelerator instead.
    
    This is the case for NVDA Dev & Test Toolbox add-on where the add-on's name is used as category in the multi-category settings dialog and thus also as panel name.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The panel's name will match the category name, even in the case this name contains an ampersand (&) character.
    
    Description of development approach
    Double the ampersand in the panel's name.

    Summary of the issue:

    Description of development approach
    The _addonStoreGui.controls.messageDialogs._shouldInstallWhenAddonTooOldDialog was being imported incorrectly which was causing the ModuleNotFoundError.

    NVDAObject.presentationType: groupings with position information but no name and no description should still be treated as content I.e. announced in focus ancestry. (#14878)
    
    NVDA filteres controls with a role of groupping out of being presented in the focus ancestry if they have no name or description. However, there is a trend with some newer Microsoft products to add position info to these unlabeled groupings (E.g. grouping 1 of 5) and it is requested that NvDA announce these as they provide very deliberate topology to the user.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will now report unlabeled groupings that have useful position information, such as in recent versions of Microsoft Office 365 menus.
    
    Description of development approach
    NVDA.presentationType now treats groupings specifically, only changing them to layout if they have no name, no description, and no position information.

    Improve responsiveness of input and focus by pumping immediately instead of after a delay. (#14928)
    
    Currently, everything in NVDA, including responding to keyboard input and focus changes, goes through the core pump. The core pump is always run with a slight delay. Assuming nothing else is already queued, any input or focus change will not be processed for a minimum of 10 ms. In reality, it's potentially longer due to the system timer resolution and the fact that timers are low priority messages. We should be aiming for the fastest possible response to user input and focus changes.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will respond slightly faster to commands and focus changes.
    
    Description of development approach
    1. The core pump has been refactored.
    ◦ Rather than using NonReEntrantTimer, it now uses wx.Timer directly and guards re-entry itself for better control.
    ◦ There is a method (queueRequest) which uses wx.CallAfter to execute the request on the main thread if necessary, avoiding recursion. However, if a delayed pump is requested on the main thread, starting the timer will happen there, rather than being queued via the window message.
    ◦ A main thread method triggered by wx.CallAfter (processRequest) manages scheduling/executing the pump to make state management easier.
    ◦ The pump always queues a subsequent request using wx.CallAfter rather than executing it directly to avoid recursion and to ensure that other window messages have a chance to execute.
    2. requestPump has a new immediate argument which specifies whether the pump should happen as soon as possible or after the delay. Delayed pumps are still useful in most cases for rate limiting and filtering, so this defaults to False.
    3. queueHandler.queueFunction has an _immediate argument which is passed to requestPump. It is _ prefixed to mitigate conflicts with keyword arguments intended for queued functions.
    4. inputCore, scriptHandler, focus changes and live text output all request an immediate core pump.
    5. As an exception, a gesture can set the private _immediate attribute to False to prevent immediate pumps. This is set on all touch hover gestures to avoid exhausting the window message queue, since hover gestures are queued every pump if there is an active hover.

    Toggle braille show selection indicator also with input gesture (#14959)
    
    Fixes #14948
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Selection is indicated with dots 7 and 8 which may cause difficulties for reading.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    There is feature flag setting "Show selection" in Braille category which default behavior is Enabled. There is also possibility to use input gesture to cycle setting.
    
    Description of development approach
    Feature flag (BoolFlag) showSelection which default behavior is Enabled. There is no display string for DEFAULT member. Simple helper function _featureFlagDefaultBehaviorDisplayString returns display string for ui.message when default value is cycled with input gesture.

    Consideration of the language to use in the User Guide, when describing all add-ons as free in the store, while certain add-ons require the purchase of components or licenses in order to do anything.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Revised language.
    
    Description of development approach
    Edited the language to be more in line with the comments in #14966. It may still not be as desired, but this provides a context to revise it in.

    Fix Excel cell reporting lagging behind (#14984)
    
    Fixes #14983
    Fixes #12200
    Fixes #12108?
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Moving rapidly in Excel can result in lagging one cell behind when reporting focus.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Rapid movement in Excel will now always report the last cell.
    
    Description of development approach
    First and foremost, NVDA was relying on the current focus object to cache the current selection in Excel rather than getting the current selection before executing the gesture. This resulted in the one behind behavior. There was logic to check for selection changes, but it detected a change based on the wrong old selection.
    I also revamped the logic a bit based on #14708, i.e. perform three attempts before doing a time.sleep.

    Moved the new Add-on Store subchapter to its own chapter in the User Guide (#14971)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The Add-on Store subchapter was long enough to warrant a standalone chapter.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Moved the store subchapter of "Extra Tools", to its own chapter before "Extra Tools".
    Consequently, reduced all headings by one numbering level.
    Renamed the new chapter from "Add-on Store", to "Add-ons and the Add-on Store".
    Added a stub under the tools menu "Add-on store" description in the "Extra Tools" chapter, pointing to the new chapter.
    Wrote a new introductory section, placing the description of add-ons first, and description of store second. Mostly based on what was there before, but more focused on the add-ons than the store at first.
    Includes proposed rewording of the non-free add-ons sentences.

    Proposed revisions to add-on store user guide subchapter (#14966)
    
    Part of #13985
    
    Summary of the issue:
    After reading the proposed add-on store user guide sections, I thought they could be more user friendly. The current form appeared to assume more knowledge than the user may have.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The following summarizes the changes I made to each section.
    
    Add-on Store:
    Rewrote introductory section to better explain what add-ons are.
    Explained that it being a "store" does not mean users must pay.
    Browsing add-ons:
    Better explained the use case for alt+l.
    Explained what "selecting an add-on" means.
    Elaborated a bit more on actions.
    Add-on list views:
    Changed the sentence order to be more logical.
    Noted the possibility of view changing via arrow keys.
    Include incompatible add-ons:
    This heading was duplicated.
    Changed the first one to "Filtering for enabled or disabled add-ons".
    
    Filtering for enabled or disabled add-ons:
    Wrote a substantive introductory section, explaining enabled/disabled states.
    
    Include incompatible add-ons:
    Minor grammar.
    
    Filter add-ons by channel:
    Slightly more explanation for beta add-ons.
    Moved explanations before usage instructions.
    Search add-ons:
    Changed title to "Searching for add-ons".
    Added instructions on how to reach the search field.
    Removed the line "Add-ons can be filtered by display name, publisher and description.", because there are no instructions on how to do that. Expect to add back in later, after that part can be more easily explained.
    Add-on actions:
    Made the instructions more complete.
    
    Installing add-ons:
    Added an NV Access disclaimer at the top.
    I Used the word "vetted", because that has been used to describe NV Access accepting add-ons into the store, by some members in the community, and I wanted to make clear that they are not "vetted" in any way by NV Access.
    Slight clarifications.
    Removed a rogue space at the end of a line.
    Removing Add-ons:
    Minor word change to avoid proximate word repetition.
    
    Disabling and Enabling Add-ons:
    Changed "a status" to "the status", since the cases are specific.
    
    Incompatible Add-ons:
    Suggested grammar changes for better flow.
    Added potential reasons why a user may want to disable all add-ons.

    Eurobraille bnote and bbook automatic detection (#14690)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The b.note "VID_28AC&PID_0012"/"VID_28AC&PID_0013" is not detected automatically
    The b.book "VID_28AC&PID_0020"/"VID_28AC&PID_0021" is not detected automatically
    the b.note joystick1Left/joystick1Right should do the action "braille_scrollBack/Forward" instead of "review_next/previousCharacter"
    when connected to a b.note/b.book, a message should be send to the braille display with the format {"S", "n", "NVDA/XX"}, where "XX" is the number of the COM-port. A {"S", "n" ""} message should be sent when disconnecting.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA automatically detects the b.note and b.book
    some gestures changed when a b.note is connected
    
    Description of development approach
    I have added the PD/VID for the b.note and b.book to bdDetect.py for automatic detection.
    In the existing eurobraille.py display driver I have added the "deviceType" for the b.note and b.book
    In the existing eurobraille.py, when a b.note is connected, another gesture map is used than the default one for the change in joystick1Left/joystick1Right.
    I have changed the name to "eurobraille Displays"
    In the existing eurobraille.py, when a device is connected and is confirmed to be a b.note or b.book, NVDA sends a identifier for the connection. When NVDA terminates it sends an empty message to reset this identifier to the display.

    Add-on store (#13985)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Historically, NVDA users have had to browse websites or use add-ons, not directly run/developed by NV Access, in order to learn about, download, and install add-ons. For a long time, easier manual updates for add-ons, and automatic updates for add-ons has been desired by NVDA users. Additionally, with the more common and structured approach to add-on API compatibility breaks, lowering the friction for delivery of updated (and compatible) add-ons is more important than ever.
    
    User stories enabled by this work:
    
    As an NVDA user, I want to easily browse add-ons which are compatible with my version of NVDA, to learn if they may fulfill an unmeet user need.
    As an NVDA user, I want to be able to install compatible NVDA add-ons that I have determined will fulfill an unmet user need.
    Additionally, this work unblocks the following user stories which may yet be incorporated into this PR:
    
    As an NVDA user, I want to be notified when there are updates to add-ons I have installed, so that I can manually update the add-ons when I am ready to do so.
    As an NVDA user, I want NVDA to automatically keep add-ons up to date with the latest version available.
    When NVDA notifies of an update (to NVDA), I want to be able to check the compatibility status of the add-ons I have installed, so that I can determine whether the NVDA update will break my core requirements.
    Description of changes for the user:
    A new dialog is introduced (NVDA menu, tools, addon store) which shows the latest versions of add-ons (submitted to the add-on store).
    
    The list of functionality for the add-on store is expansive.
    This should be covered in the user guide and manual test plan

    Event handler: introduce virtual desktop announcement switch handling (#14932)
    
    Fixes #5641
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In Windows 10 and later, NVDA does not announce virtual desktop names wen they are opened, switched, and closed.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will announce names of virtual desktops when opening, switching, and closing them.
    
    Description of development approach
    Event handler is extended to include a virtual desktop switch handler and an extension to execute event to catch a name change event coming from CSRSS.
    
    ---
    
    commits:
    
    * Event handler: update copyright header. Re #5641
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktops announcement: use a dedicated function to handle possible virtual desktop switches. Re #5641.
    
    Original work by Jamie Teh (Mozilla): define a dedicated function to handle posible (and real) Windows 10/11 virtual desktop switche announcements. This function checks to make sure this is Widows 10 or later, and if yes, announces desktop name as defined in the event handler module, and clears this string once announcements are done. The actual event responsible for placing virtual desktop name in event handler is name change event from CSRSS (client/server runtime subsystem/Windows subsystem) process, specificlaly desktop object. Handling name change event will be done as part of handling gain focus event, specifically when doing pre-gain focus routine.
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop switch announcements: detect name change event coming from CSRSS/desktop object and treat as a possible virtual desktop switch. Re #5641.
    
    Original idea from Jamie Teh (Mozilla): in 'execute event' function, detect namechange coming from CSRSS/desktop object and treat it as a possible virtual desktop name change before handling focus events. If it turns out this is indeed a virtual desktop switch, set virtual desktop name, then queue handle possible virtual desktop switch routine (250 milliseconds) so desktop switches can be announced when opening/closing/switching virtual desktops while focused on the desktop.
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop switch announcements: handle possible virtual desktop switches after handling new foreground event. Re #5641.
    
    Credit: Jamie Teh (Mozilla): handle possible virtual desktop switch announcements after handling new foreground announcement in 'do pre gain focus' routine. This allows virtual desktop names to be announced between actual desktop switch and handling gain focus event, more noticeable when creating new virtual desktops.
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop switch announcement: limit announcement to Windows 10 Version 1903 and later. Re #5641.
    
    A note from Jamie Teh (Mozila): virtual desktop switch announcement works more effectively in Windows 10 Version 1903 (May 2019 Update) and later, therefore restrict virtual desktop announcement to that feature update and later.
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop switch announcement and surrounding code: lint
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop switch announcement: use formatted string literals when logging exceptions with execute event routine.
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop switch announcement: add typing info for virtual desktop name field and handle possible desktop switch function. Re #5641
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop switch announcement: use a dedicated variable to detect Windows 10 1903 and later. Re #5641.
    
    In addition to placing winVersion module import at the top of the file, use a dedicated flag to indicate support for virtual desktop switch announcements in Windows 10 Version 1903 (May 2019 Update) and later.
    
    * Event handler: move virtual desktop constants to the top of the file.
    
    Reported by several testers: in some cases, NVDA fails to start due to type hint scope issue if a constant is placed between functions. Therefore, move virtual desktops handling to top fo the file next to other constants and data structures.
    
    * Event handler: lint (Flake8 ET126)
    
    * Event handler/virtual desktop announcements: make virtual desktop name and announcement check variables private. Re #5641.
    
    Reviewed by Sean Budd (NV Access): make virtual desktop name and can nanouncement virtual desktop name variables private - at the moment no add-on appears to need this functionality but this can change if requested by add-on authors.
    
    * update changes

    Improve shortcut key reporting (#14900)
    
    Fixes #10807
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When reported by speech, some shortcut key or combination cannot be understood correctly in the following cases:
    
    A punctuation may not be reported due to symbol level being too low, e.g. "alt+." reported as "alt plus" instead of "alt plus dot" in Outlook.
    A character reported as a word instead of being reported as a character. E.g. in French, the letter "à" (a grave) is a word; in MS Word, the shortcut "alt+à" is reported as "alt plus a" instead of "alt plus a grave". Same for "Y" which is a word in French and the name of the letter is "i grec" whereas the word just reads "i" ("ee").
    Description of user facing changes
    Shortcut key reporting will be improved in some cases. This applies to on-demand reporting (shift+numpad2) as well as when "Report Object Shortcut Keys" option is checked in Object presentation settings.
    
    The cases where it should be improved are:
    
    punctuation key, e.g. "." (dot)
    letter keys when the name of the letter is not spoken the same way as the equivalent one-letter word, e.g. "à" or "y" in French.
    Braille reporting should remain unchanged.
    
    Description of development approach
    Generate a speech sequence to report shortcut keys from the shortcut key string provided by the API. This shortcut key string may contain one or two shortcuts. When there are two shortcuts, they are separated by two spaces.
    Each shortcut is split into its component keys.
    If a key is a punctuation, symbol reporting processing is used so that the punctuation can be reported no matter the punctuation level.
    If a key is a single character, CharacterModeCommand is passed to the synth so that the name of the letter is reported and not a possible one-letter word.

    soffice: Implement methods for status bar announcement (#14933)
    
    Fixes #11698
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Announcement of the status bar in LibreOffice (e.g. triggered by NVDA+End) didn't work because the default implementations do not work for the LibreOffice case.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Announcement of the status bar (e.g. triggered
    by NVDA+End) works for LibreOffice.
    
    Description of development approach
    Override the default app module implementation to retrieve the status bar and announce its text in the LibreOffice app module, since the default implementations are not sufficient for the LibreOffice case:
    
    To retrieve the status bar object, locate the descendant with the corresponding role, but only descend into children of role ROOTPANE and WINDOW for performance reasons.
    
    To generate text from the status bar object, retrieve the text of each status bar child using the IAccessibleText interface. (The default implementation in api.py only uses the object names and values, which are both empty.)

    Use a single APC and completion routine (#14924)
    
    Related to #14899, #14312, #14627
    Fixes #14895
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Despite several attempts to fix this, NVDA's IoThread can crash without a clear cause.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Less crashes, most likely, as tests indicate that this is the case.
    
    Description of development approach
    As proposed by @jcsteh , rather than creating a new function pointer for every APC or completion routine call, use a single internal APC and completion routine and use an internal cache to store the python functions, not the actual APC functions.

    Rewrote the paragraph describing ways to access the NVDA menu, in user guide section "The NVDA Menu" (#14936)
    
    Fixes #14929
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Some users do not know that Shift+F10 is an alternative to the Applications key for accessing the Context menu.
    As a good reason to provide this information in the user guide, make note of it in the first place which describes use of the Applications key: accessing the NVDA menu.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Altered the user guide section in question as follows:
    
    Since there were several ways listed to access the NVDA menu already, and Clarify "applications key" and how to access the context menu in the user guide #14929 asked to add another one: put all the methods in a list.
    Described the Shift+F10 alternative to the Applications key.
    Added code markers around all keys in that section, except "Windows logo key+B", which is written differently.
    Moved the right-click mouse option to last, since it is the least likely for a blind user.

    Make NVDA accurate to the second when reporting time (#14792)
    
    Closes #14742
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Currently, NVDA+F12 does not include seconds when reporting time.
    In some online shopping malls merchants often have limited-time promotions, For example, "3 minutes and 59 seconds left" to start flash sale.
    It might help if the visually impaired could get the seconds of the current time in a more accurate way.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA does not control the format of the reported time, it is determined by the user's system settings, specifically, NVDA will refer to the 'Long time' option in the system settings.
    
    In the latest Windows 11 operating system, Microsoft allows users to choose whether to display seconds on the system clock.
    For Windows 10 and older operating systems, users can choose whether to display seconds on the system clock by changing the registry.
    If the user has allowed seconds to be displayed on the system clock, then NVDA +F12 will also include the seconds.

    Rewrote the user guide section about the settings dialog (#14937)
    
    Fixes #14927
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The issue asked that Ctrl+Tab and Shift+Ctrl+Tab be listed in the user guide section regarding the settings dialog, since many users don't know they can use those to move between categories.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    While editing the section, I found some awkward and seemingly redundant wording, and some unclear portions.
    
    Reworded the initial paragraph to be more clear about categories and settings.
    Added a note that Ctrl+Tab and Shift+Ctrl+Tab can move between settings categories.
    Clarified a sentence about what shortcut keys for categories do.
    Made the note about adding shortcut keys for categories more clear. As it was written previously, it implied that adding shortcut keys might be the ONLY way to access those categories.

    Inform the user that the configuration cannot be saved from a temporary version of NVDA (launcher) (#14914)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When running NVDA temp version (from launcher), the configuration cannot be save due to possible compatibility of version scheme. When pressing NVDA+control+C, the configuration is not saved and a message is logged in the log. However, NVDA reports "Configuration saved".
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When running the temporary version of the launcher:
    
    NVDA will not report erroneously that the config was saved when trying to save it with NVDA+control+C command.
    NVDA will also not offer anymore the possibility to save the configuration in the NVDA menu.
    Description of development approach
    As when running in secure mode:
    
    When trying to save the config, use the decorator to block action and report that the config cannot be saved in this version of NVDA.
    Also removed the "Save configuration" item in the NVDA menu when running the temp version (launcher)

    Fix for the left and right pointing angle brackets, one of the respective typographic quotes (#14940)
    
    Fixes #14939
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When the symbol level is set to none, left double angle bracket and right double angle bracket are read, which should not be the case.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The left double angle bracket and right double angle bracket symbols are no longer read, when the symbol level is set to none and speech synthesizers will properly react on these symbols.
    
    Description of development approach
    This needed just the change of the english symbols.dic file. It should propagate all locales and languages. It overwrites erroneous definition in dldr.dic for all locales.

    Report the state of cell formatting when using formatting shortcuts in Excel (#14923)
    
    In Excel, when applying formatting to cells, nothing is reported. Instead, in Word, toggling bold, italic or underline is reported.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When using Excel shortcuts to toggle the format of a full cell in Excel, the result is now reported. The following toggle are supported:
    • bold: control+b or control+shift+2
    • italic: control+I or control+shift+3
    • underline: control+U or control+shift+4
    • strikethrough: control+shift+5 (Note: did not find any other shortcut for it)
    
    Description of development approach
    • As done for Word text, use object model to look at the properties of the cell after the shortcut is executed.
    • Copied the polling function of Word's code to check for value changes polling the object model. (I had initially thought that it was not required, but testing on another system, I have found that it was required)
    • Implement the scripts on the whole worksheet so that the scripts work either on single cell or on multi-cell selections. Taking advantage that both excelCellObject and excelRangeObject have a font attribute.

    Revert "Improve responsiveness of input and focus by pumping immediately instead of after a delay. (#14701)" (#14925)
    
    This reverts pr #14701, commit cc8b5ad
    
    Link to issue number:
    Fixes #14753
    May fix #14803
    
    Summary of the issue:
    After the merging of pr #14701, It was reported in #14753 that with input help mode on and moving your finger around the touch screen, many errors would be logged and eventually input help mode would be disabled.
    
    The recursion itself was caused by the core pump's Notify method calling request directly, which itself calls Notify.
    The obvious fix would be to wx.CallAfter the call to request. However, this then caused the WX event loop to fill up with responses to these call afters, and due to the way the wx event loop works (msgWaitForMultipleObjects waiting on a pending event win32 event), the event loop never ended up getting a chance to process OS and 3rd party messages. And because we monkeypatch CallAfter to PostMessage (in case we are in a win32 modal or menu and don't wake up) the win32 message queue was being filled completely thus not allowing future messages to be posted.
    @jcsteh and I have considered several different ways of trying to work around this. Most of which have not been successful. There are probably more things we could try, but for now it is better to revert until we can get this right.
    
    Description of development approach
    Fully reverts pr #14701 for now.

    Try to log exceptions in IoThread (#14899)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    I'm still seeing access violations in the IoThread here and there, same for @bramd. I really want to track these down! We need to handle those more gracefully anyway.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Better logging
    
    Description of development approach
    De run block of the IOThread is now wrapped in a try/except that logs the stack. I hope the stack will give us more info about what's going wrong here.

    Bugfix when resetting configuration (#14894)
    
    Fixes #13187
    
    Summary of the issue:
    After having modified a parameter in a profile and then reset it to its original value with NVDA+control+C, it was not possible to save the configuration with NVDA+control+R; NVDA was complaining that the file system was probably read-only.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will no longer refuse to save the configuration after a configuration reset.
    
    Description of development approach
    Bugfix: when resetting the config, config.conf._dirtyProfiles is cleared
    
    I have also narrowed the exception filtering when saving the config since in #13187, we get a message related to file write error, whereas the real error had nothing to do with it: it was a KeyError when trying to find "notepad" in config.conf._profileCache. I have filtered on PermissionError which is the error that I get when I set nvda.ini (or the whole NVDA setting folder) as read-only and try to save the config.

    Support for audio output using WASAPI (#14697)
    
    NVDA's existing audio output code (nvwave) is largely very old and uses WinMM, a very old legacy Windows audio API. It is also written in pure Python, contains quite a few threading locks necessitated by WinMM, and parts of it have become rather difficult to reason about. There are several known stability and audio glitching issues that are difficult to solve with the existing code.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    At the very least, this fixes audio glitches at the end of some utterances as described in #10185 and #11061.
    I haven't noticed a significant improvement in responsiveness on my system, but my system is also very powerful. It's hard to know whether the stability issues (e.g. #11169) are fixed or not. Time will tell as I run with this more.
    
    Description of development approach
    1. The bulk of the WASAPI implementation is written in C++. The WASAPI interfaces are easy to access in C++ and difficult to access in Python. In addition, this allows for the best possible performance, given that we regularly and continually stream audio data.
    2. The WinMM code fired callbacks by waiting for the previous chunk to finish playing before sending the next chunk, which could result in buffer underruns (glitches) if callbacks were close together (Python 3 versions of NVDA produce a scratch in the speech when finishing the end of a line #10185 and Texts with multiple line spacings are voiced with NVDA + down arrow and voices crack #11061). In contrast, the WASAPI code uses the audio playback clock to fire callbacks independent of data buffering, eliminating glitches caused by callbacks.
    3. The WinMM WavePlayer class is renamed to WinmmWavePlayer. The WASAPI version is called WasapiWavePlayer. Rather than having a common base class, this relies on duck-typing. I figured it didn't make sense to have a base class given that WasapiWavePlayer will likely replace WinmmWavePlayer altogether at some point.
    4. WavePlayer is set to one of these two classes during initialisation based on a new advanced configuration setting. WASAPI defaults to disabled.
    5. WasapiWavePlayer.feed can take a ctypes pointer and size instead of a Python bytes object. This avoids the overhead of additional memory copying and Python objects in cases where we are given a direct pointer to memory anyway, which is true for most (if not all) speech synthesisers.
    6. For compatibility, WinmmWavePlayer.feed supports a ctypes pointer as well, but it just converts it to a Python bytes object.
    7. eSpeak and oneCore have been updated to pass a ctypes pointer to WavePlayer.feed.
    8. When playWaveFile is used asynchronously, it now feeds audio on the background thread, rather than calling feed on the current thread. This is necessary because the WASAPI code blocks once the buffer (400 ms) is full, rather than having variable sized buffers. Even with the WinMM code, playWaveFile code could block for a short time (nvwave.playWaveFile not fully async #10413). This should improve that also.
    9. WasapiWavePlayer supports associating a stream with a specific audio session, which allows that session to be separately configurable in the system Volume Mixer. NVDA tones and wave files have been split into a separate "NVDA sounds" session. WinmmWavePlayer has a new setSessionVolume method that can be used to set the volume of a session. This at least partially addresses Ability to adjust volume of sounds #1409.

    Do not include userConfig folder in pot sources (#14867)
    
    Fixes #14820
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The checkPot script used to check translation comments also checks the subfolder userConfig. This is not correct since the code in userConfig is not NVDA's code but code from add-ons or from the scratchpad.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The checkPot script does not check the userConfig subfolder anymore.
    
    Description of development approach
    In addition to COM interface folder, the userConfig folder is also excluded from the check.
    Also the exclusion of these two folders is made in the folders' list rather than in the Glob expression since scons' Glob does not support filtering recursively subvolders; this is also probably more efficient to filter the folders than using Glob for each file.

    If there is working connection, and I/O error occurs, port presence is checked before trying to open it again. USB serial port disappears when cable is plugged out or device is powered off, thus efforts to open port are then useless. Debug level log entries are also more readable telling that port is not present instead of exception info.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added boolean function _portPresent to class ReadThread in _threading.py.

    Use UI automation for RICHEDIT60W in Microsoft Excel on Windows 10 and above (#14839)
    
    Found when investigating #5221
    Fixes #6871
    Fixes #11512
    Though both of these issues had already been avoided in Outlook 2016+ by #14280
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When arrowing through a password in the password field in the Protect Sheet dialog in Microsoft Excel (alt h o p), NVDA produces an error and says nothing. Similarly, when tabbing to that control and the cursor is already on a password character, NVDA produces an error and the focus is not announced at all.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA no longer fails to announce the focus when tabbing to the password field in Excel's Protect sheet dialog.
    
    Description of development approach
    1. In the ITextDocument TextInfo's text property: catch COMError when calling range.text. This can occur when the edit control is protected. Just log a debugWarning and return the empty string - there is nothing else we can do about this error. This allows NVDA to announce the focus without an error. And when arrowing through the characters, 'blank' will be spoken rather than an error, which is better than nothing.
    2. In the appModule for Excel: treat RICHEDIT60W windows as having a good UI automation implementation if on Windows 10 or higher and Office 2016 or higher. Office 2016 on Win 10+ has a very good UI automation implementation for RICHEDIT60W, which includes being able to fetch 'circle' characters when arrowing through a password.
    So in summary, on Office 2016 win10+ the error is gone and NvDA can announce 'circle' when arrowing through password characters in the Protect sheet dialog.
    On older versions of Office / Windows, the error is gone, though NVDA will announce 'blank' when arrowing through password characters.

    Display in braille the character number upon request (#14837)
    
    Fixes #14826
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When pressing 3 times numpad2, the character number is reported by speech (both in decimal form and hexadecimal form). However, for braille users it would be useful to have this information.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When pressing three times numpad2 to call the script "Report current character in review", the reported information (character number in decimal and hexadecimal) is also reported in braille, not only by speech.
    First press and second press of this script remain unchanged since:
    
    First press only report the current character which is already available at the review cursor's position on the braille display, provided that the braille follows automatically (default settings) or review.
    Second press is a feature dedicated to speech users, when they cannot hear correctly the character name.
    Description of development approach
    Added a braille update as done in ui.message. We do not use directly ui.message since the hex value has to be spelt.

    Added a Development Guide chapter describing and listing extension points (#14810)
    
    Closes #14648
    
    Summary of the issue:
    There is currently no definitive list of all available extension points. Since these seem to be the preferred future direction for add-ons and other code to interoperate with NVDA internals, it would be valuable to include a list of them in the Developer Guide.
    
    It would also be valuable to include various examples and further documentation there, but that can come in a later PR.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    Created a new chapter in the Developer Guide, describing very briefly what extension points are, mainly as a concept introduction. This could stand to be expanded significantly.
    Used grep to find all occurrences of "extensionPoint" in the source.
    For each one, determined why the module was being imported, and if it was actually used to create an extension point, added appropriate entries to the dev guide describing that extensionPoint.

    Windows 11/input experience window: recognize IME interface (#14836)
    
    Closes #14509
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA does not recognize Windows 11 IME interface, or if it does, announces candidate items multiple times.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will recognize and announce Windows 11 IME candidate items used when entering text in languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other languages through use of input method editors (IME).
    
    Description of development approach
    Three changes to modern keyboard app module:
    
    Recognize IME candidate UI and candidate items found in Windows 11.
    Unlike Windows 10, Windows 11 adds an extra element to IME candidate window, therefore descend one more level when locating IME candidate items in app module version of UIA element selected event handler.
    Veto UIA element selected event for IME candidate item in Windows 11 until a solution that allows focus and element selected events to cooperate when announcing IME candidate items.
    For the third change, feedback from people speaking and typing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean would be helpful (this PR was based on Korean nput but could be expanded to cover Chinese, Japanese, and perhaps other languages in the future, either part of this pull request (unlikely) or in future PR's).
    
    Commits:
    
    * appModules/modern keyboard: recognize Windows 11 IME candidate items. Re #14509.
    
    Windows 11 IME candiate's parent window has AutomationId of 'TEMPLATE_PART_CandidatePanel' and items underneath it wil be reocnigzed as IME candidate items.
    
    * Modern keyboard/Windows 11 IME: recognize IME UI in Windows 11. Re #14509.
    
    If UI Automation Id is 'TEMPLATE_PART_CandidatePanel' or 'IME_Prediction_Window' and role is either a list or a pop-up menu, reocgnize this as Windows 11 IME user interface.
    
    * IME candidate item: do not allow UIA elemnet selected event in Windows 11.
    
    Windows 11 raises focus event when IME candidate receives system focus, and without turning off element selected event, it will result in NVDA announcing candidate items twice. Therefore return early if IME candidate item raises element selected event while running Windows 11.
    
    * IME/element selected: descend one more level when handling IME candidate item in Windows 11.
    
    Unlike Windows 10, Windows 11 IME window adds an extra element when descending IME window hierarchy, therefore descend one more level to handle IME candidate item and UIA eement selected event coming from it.

    Avoid freeze removing blank lines from IMPROVED and END_INCLUSIVE UIA consoles (#14822)
    
    Fixes #14689
    
    Summary of the issue:
    IMPROVED (apiLevel 1) and END_INCLUSIVE (apiLevel 0) UIA consoles produce a lot of blank lines (more than 17000) in some output, causing a NVDA freeze during speech dictionary processing.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    I added a _get_text method to ConsoleUIATextInfo class (for apiLevel 1 consoles), stripping all \r\n on the rightside of output from _get_text of superclass (implicitly used previously).
    For apiLevel 0 consoles (ConsoleUIATextInfoWorkaroundEndInclusive class), I simply considered that the _get_text already present calls _get_text from superclass, that is, ConsoleUIATextInfo, so text is already cleaned.

    Fix open of Contributors and License Help menu options on Windows 11  (#14816)
    
    Fixes #14725
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Under Windows 11, attempting to open the NVDA Help menu items "Contributors" or "License", results in Notepad trying to open nonsense filenames while using installed, normal user level, copies of NVDA
    
    Through testing, this has been narrowed to a bug in os.startfile in Python 3.7 as invoked on Windows 11, though the actual bug may be in a lower level library. The bug does not seem to occur when using the commandline "start" command.
    It also does not occur in portable or admin level copies of NVDA.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Restores the ability to open the Contributors List or License file from the NVDA Help menu.
    
    Description of development approach
    Through testing, I and @britechguy were able to narrow the source of the errors, and determine that attempting to open the file for editing, rather than by trusting the Windows open file association for .txt files, would open these files in Notepad correctly.
    
    Taken from the text of the commit:
    
    Added the _displayTextFileWorkaround function to the systemUtils module.
    Called it wherever os.startfile was opening a .txt file in gui/__init__.py.
    The function uses os.startfile's "edit" operation to open the text file, which still uses Notepad, at least on most systems.
    Additionally:
    
    gui.MainFrame was importing systemUtils late, in init, and onRunCOMRegistrationFixesCommand.
    Moved to a single import in top section.
    Testing strategy:
    Manual testing with 2023.1's Python console, that calling os.startfile as described, opens these files correctly under Windows 11. While calling it the standard way from the Python console, results in nonsense filenames being delivered to Notepad, and the subsequent failure of the task.
    Using a try build of this PR, tested opening these help menu items on Windows 10, with expected success.
    Tested that installing a try build of this PR on Windows 11, could open the files from the menu, and could open a copy of copying.txt at the root of the system drive, using the Python console.
    A portable copy generated from this PR, placed in the root directory of a USB stick, could open its included text files from the Help menu, and could open a copy of copying.txt placed at the root of the USB drive.
    Additionally, to confirm that consolidating and moving the imports of systemUtils didn't break anything, I tested that NVDA launched, and the COM Registration Fixing Tool still works, under Windows 10, which is sufficient.
    
    Tested on:
    
    Windows 11: 22H2, build 22621.1555
    Windows 10: 22H2, build 19045.2846
    Known issues with pull request:
    It is not necessary to use operation="edit" under Windows 10. Since this seemed (1) rather harmless, and (2) a low impact bug, I didn't think it was necessary to test for Windows version before deciding which call structure to use for the new function.
    It is conceivable, that opening for editing will have side effects on some systems. However, since it seems reasonable to presume that a user who has made editing text files open in some other program than Notepad is quite experienced, I thought the negative potential here was rather low to non-existent.
    When we migrate to a newer Python version, the necessity of this workaround should be reevaluated, as hopefully this will be fixed by a newer library.

    Fixed a bug causing wrong deprecation warnings or errors. (#14806)
    
    
    Fix-up of #14350.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Running NVDA 2023.1 (and older), with add-ons and/or scratchpad enabled:
    
    I get the following deprecation warnings:
    
    When opening start menu:
    WARNING - appModuleHandler._warnDeprecatedAliasAppModule (15:49:46.531) - MainThread (19688):
    Importing appModules.searchapp is deprecated, instead import appModules.searchui.
    When switching to Notepad++:
    WARNING - appModuleHandler._warnDeprecatedAliasAppModule (15:50:26.621) - MainThread (19688):
    Importing appModules.notepad++ is deprecated, instead import appModules.notepadPlusPlus.
    And if I force errors on deprecated code by modifying NVDAState._allowDeprecatedAPI to return False, I get errors instead.
    
    This is not expected since these warnings/errors come from NVDA's core code which should not (and actually does not) contain deprecated code.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No more wrong deprecation warnings/errors due to NVDA's core appModules when opening start menu or switching to Notepad++
    
    Description of development approach
    appModules.__path__ contains the paths where NVDA has to search appModules. It contains first the folder in the scratchpad, then the folders in add-on containing appModules and finally the core appModule folder. Thus we need to look at the last element of appModules.__path__, not the first as it was done.

    Update Add-on Manifest spec descriptions (#14754)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The add-on datastore has certain expectations of an add-on manifest.
    These expectations are not required to work with NVDA, but require manifests to be updated to be hosted on the add-on datastore.
    We may want to make these changes in a future API breaking release, and add validation to enforce them.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    Updates the add-on manifest spec to match the requirements of the add-on store better.
    We may want to add validation for these requirements in a future API breaking release.

    Fix message hooking regression (#14789)
    
    Follow up of #14759
    Fixes #14784
    Partially reverts 9b97de0
    
    Summary of the issue:
    At least one custom IME is reported to no longer work in editable controls within NVDA.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix the regression
    
    Description of development approach
    We no longer use the background thread to handle cancellable messages, as it seems using the background thread causes IME messages to be discareded. This means a partial revert of 9b97de0. In fact, this pr removes the background thread but keeps the event based approach to cancel calls from NVDA's watchdog.

    Logging: Fix some edge cases when identifying if the logged messages comes from external code or not. (#14812)
    
    Discussion in #14806
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When logging NVDA tries to determine if the logged message comes from its own code or from an add-on. In some cases it does so incorrectly.
    
    Case 1: Directory prepended to sys.path by an add-on
    Some add-ons have to modify sys.path to import additional libraries. NVDA's logHandler relied on the fact that the first entry in path represents the location of NVDA's source code. While add-on developers should really clean-up after themselves i.e. modify path only for as long as necessary to import additional libraries this is not something we can enforce. Initially observed by @CyrilleB79 for an add-on for ChatGPT.
    
    Case 2: Messages logged from add-ons installed in the default config for source copies
    By default configuration folder for source copies is placed next to NVDA sources, i.e. in the source folder. When determining if the path belongs to NVDA or not we used to check if the given path starts with NVDA's source folder which was true for the plugins in the user config even though the code was not a part of NVDA.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    This should affect only developers who inspect the log.
    
    Description of development approach
    When checking if the path is external or not we no longer rely on sys.path - rather the location of the logHandler is used to determine the true location of NVDA's source code. In addition if the path is beneath the current NVDA's config it is always marked as external.

    A command to cycle through available languages for Windows OCR (#14805)
    
    Closes #13036
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #13036, the reporter needs an input gesture to quickly change the language of Windows OCR.
    
    More generally, if a user has to modify frequently a setting for their activity, a specific command to modify this setting is more handy than always opening the settings dialog.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    A new unbound command has been added to cycle through available languages for Windows OCR. It is in the Misc category, the same as the one of the already existing command to recognize the navigator object with Windows OCR.
    
    Description of development approach
    Made the script based on what was in the settings OCR panel
    Made the assumption that at least one language (probably English) is installed on all systems supporting UwpOCR; this assumption is already done if you read the code of the OCR settings panel and we have not had people complaining of issues.
    While at it, moved 3 isolated class variables related to screen curtain next to the related script.

    Comment clarification/typo fixes about extensionPoints, across six files (#14811)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    While working on #14810, I found several places where comments about the core extensionPoints could be made clearer, or had typos/capitalization errors/questionable grammar.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    I fixed them as I went along, and scooped them all into their own branch. Here is the result.
    
    I changed no code in this, and nothing structural has been altered. That is, where #: style comments were used in some places, and docstring style comments in others, I left them that way. I'm not actually sure what we prefer now. I wasn't trying to lint anything, just fix language.

    Avoid freeze in Windows API Level 0 and 1 console when UIA support is enabled (#14703)
    
    Fixes #14689
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Due to a bug in API Level 0 and 1 consoles (see microsoft/terminal/#5243), sometimes NVDA freezes during dictionary processing of console text, containing a huge amount of blank lines.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None.
    
    Description of development approach
    If current focus object has apiLevel 0 or 1, and difference between regular text and text with rightside blank lines stripped is greater than 100, we use cleaned text for dictionary processing.

    Add support of getting link destination of graphic links (#14783)
    
    Closes #14779
    
    Summary of the issue:
    destination of graphic links are not reported in chrome/edge
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Destination of graphic links now should be reported in chrome/edge browsers
    
    Description of development approach
    NVDA lands its focus to graphic elemeng "img" which does not have href value, but an element which is parent of that element is link.
    So one more check was introduced to ensure han if we are focusing a graphic element and its parent is a link, we are now replacing an object by its parent object

    Updated the doc for the scratchpad option (#14788)
    
    Closes #14773
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #14773, the user wanted to document when the code is loaded from the scratchpad directory.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    As discussed in the issue, it is hard to add more details in the GUI. Thus, the User Guide's paragraph describing this option has been updated. Not that it is easily reachable from the GUI thanks to context help.
    
    The following updates have been made:
    
    Added a sentence to indicate when all the modules from the scratchpad are loaded
    Added visual enhancement providers to the list of the modules that can be loaded from the scratchpad.
    Removed the sentence comparing the current situation with older versions of NVDA when the scratchpad did not exist and test modules were directly loaded from appModule, globalPlugins, etc. subfolders. Indeed, the scratchpad has been introduced in NVDA 2019.1, which is now quite old.

    Summary of the issue:
    When the AC is connected, reporting "Charging battery" may be misleading, e.g. when the battery is fully charged.
    It is more accurate to state "AC connected"
    
    Description of user facing changes
    "AC connected" is reported instead of "charging battery" when reporting battery status

    Report background and highlighted text in MS Word (#14610)
    
    Fixes #5866, fixes #7396, fixes #12101
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In these years, Microsoft Word users working without UIA had no feedback about background and highlighting colors, often used by colleagues, teachers and students.
    
    UIA has provided a partial solution when available, but its support for these features is far from perfect (see later).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Assuming UIA is not available/forcibly enabled:
    
    when color reporting is enabled in formatting preferences, users will hear background colors too;
    when marked/highlighted text reporting is enabled in formatting preferences, users will hear highlighting colors ("highlighted in {color}" and "no highlighting"), regardless of color reporting.
    Description of development approach
    It was very difficult to find a way, so I'll add some details.
    
    Initially, I used VBA objects approach, querying Paragraph.Shading.BackgroundPatternColor and Range.HighlightColorIndex over a winwordDocument.Range to calculate each time, so it was very slow.
    
    Then I found this document and, after having understood what I needed and how to find the required wdDISPID_ constants, I was able to move all work on the C++ component of nvdaHelperRemote related to winword, that appears very much faster.
    
    In window/winword.py, to take advantage of winwordColorToNVDAColor work, I added also a dict that collects indexes from wdColorIndex and decimal values from wdColor.
    
    About speech, I had to introduce a new format field, highlight-color.
    
    Now, UIA: sure, it already covers background and highlight colors, but expose them as the same attribute, via UIA_BackgroundColorAttributeId (and no, I asked, even visually they are distinct). There is an AnnotationType_Highlighted identifier, but it seems to not be used in this scenario.
    
    Locally I have a possible workaround, based on the fact that, as you see in Word Home menu, highlighting color is applied to characters, background color to paragraphs; so, if textRange has a background-color, I compare it to that retrieved from paragraph and, if I receive IUnknown/MixedAttributeValue, I assume the initial one is an highlighting color and try to get the real background color from "\r" EOL.
    
    But I'm not totally convinced, so I not included it in this PR for now.

    Create manual testing documentation procedure (#14776)
    
    Commonly tested components of NVDA should have standard test plans.
    This gives contributors a base manual testing plan when creating PRs that touch these NVDA components.
    This also gives alpha/beta testers a base test plan for NVDA.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    A directory has been created, ./tests/manual, which contains markdown files group by the NVDA component, e.g. "addon store", "start up / shutdown", "speech dictionaries", "settings", etc.
    
    The goal is to document manual test plans for commonly tested NVDA components.

    Switch import table hooks to detours (#14759)
    
    Fixes #14746
    Fixes #13335
    Partially replaces 7366dee
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA doesn't recover when a call to oleacc.AccessibleObjectFromEvent. takes a long time. It instead freezes until the call completes, and the watchdog doesn't cancel it.
    See technical discussion in #14746. In short, oleacc and UIAutomationCore don't call SendMessageW and SendMessageTimeoutW in user32 directly so we can't hook the import table of these libraries.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The str in #14746 should no longer be reproducible.
    Description of development approach
    Import table hooks have been changed to use detours. It was actually pretty trivial to do this. As a bonus, I moved the clipboard hook from the remote to the local library as suggested by @jcsteh
    I left the import table hooking mechanism in place, though it is not used by core, it is still available to add-ons.

    appModules/explorer: announce tab switches in Windows 11 2022 Update (22H2) (#14770)
    
    Closes #14388
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Later revisions of Windows 11 22H2 (2022 Update) introduced tabbed File Explorer. At the moment NVDA does not announce tab names when switching to different tabs.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will announce the name of the tab being switched to in Windows 11 2022 Update File Explorer.
    
    Description of development approach
    Similar to tabbed Notepad (#14588), use UIA element selected event handler to announce tab names. Unlike Notepad, speech should not be cut off to let NVDA announce focused item when File Explorer opens.
    
    Commits:
    
    * appModules/explorer: announce tab switches in Windows 11 2022 Update (22H2). Re #14388.
    
    Later revisions of Windows 11 2022 Update (22H2) introduces tabs to File Explorer, allowing users to press Control+Tab and Control+Shift+Tab to switch betwen tabs. Just like Notepad for Windows 11, UIA element selected event is fired when tab switching happens. Unlike Notepad implementation, speech will not be canceled (cut off) because doing so prevents announcement of list view items.

    Add support for aria-brailleroledescription from ARIA 1.3. (#14748)
    
    partial fix for #11829
    
    Summary of the issue:
    ARIA 1.3 adds a aria-brailleroledescription attribute, which allows the web author to specify a string representation for an element's role, specific to Braille.
    For example:
    
    <button aria-roledescription="planet" aria-brailleroledescription="plnt">Saturn</button>
    A button whos spoken role description will be "planet" but in Braille it will be shown as the abreviated "plnt".
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will honor the aria-brailleroledescription attribute if set by the web author, when presenting web content on a braille display.
    
    Description of development approach
    The internal work to support custom braille role text had already been added to NVDAObjects and controlFields to allow for Braille abbreviations for landmarks. this PR:
    
    Implements roleTextBraille on the IA2Web NVDAObject, exposing the content of the brailleroledescription IAccessible2 attribute if available
    In the Gecko ia2 virtualBuffer, normalizes the brailleroledescription IAccessible2 attribute to the roleTextBraille NvDA attribute on controlFields.

    Notepad with tabs: speak when switching between tabs (#14588)
    
    Closes #14587
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In recent notepad releases on windows 11 insider, notepad has gained the ability to open multiple files in the same window with tabs. When switching between tabs with control tab, NVDA does not the speak the currently selected tab or it has changed at all.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When CTRL tab is pressed, the new tab name will be spoken, similar to web browsers.
    
    Description of development approach
    Implement behavior for UIA_elementSelected, if the object is a tab and is selected, speak it.

    Bugfix: display ampersand character in the message of `nvdaControls.MessageDialog` (#14607)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When a message containing ampersand has to be displayed in nvdaControls.MessageDialog, the ampersand character is interpreted as an indication for accelerator key. Thus the ampersand character is not displayed and the following character is underlined.
    Putting here an accelerator key does not make sense here since the wx.StaticText used in this dialog is not the label of a focusable element.
    
    The real-life situation where this issue occurs is when installing NVDA Dev & Test Toolbox. The dialog indicates "Extension : NVDA Dev Test Toolbox 3.0" (without ampersand) instead of "Extension : NVDA Dev & Test Toolbox 3.0" (with ampersand).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Messages displayed in nvdaControls.MessageDialog will be displayed correctly when the message contains ampersand character. E.g. add-on install dialog and add-on install errror dialogs will display correctly the name of add-ons containing ampersand character in their name.
    
    Description of development approach
    Doubled the ampersand character when present in the message.

    Follow up of #14312: ensure IO completion routines and waitable timers are safe (#14627)
    
    Follow up of #14312
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #14312, we decoupled the background I/O thread from the braille module. However, the thread was still bound to IoBase in it's _initialRead method unless you'd override it.
    While I hoped the changes in #14312 would decrease crashing of braille, this was indeed the cause. However, crashes are still occurring here and there. I'm pretty sure I know the cause lies in the IO done completion routines that are still executed on the IO thread without ensuring that the instances of the routines still exist. I've seen this causing several access violation errors.
    Furthermore, #14312 saved bound methods in a dictionary on the iOThread. While this shouldn't be a big problem, this could cause potential issues with garbage collection (i.e. instances being kept alife forever because the APC of an instance was never called and it would be stuck in the cached apc dictionary).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Hopefully, more stability.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added the ioThread as a constructor method to IoBase and derivatives as an optional argument. If not provided (default), the default IoThread is used. It will be added as a weak reference on the IoBase instance. Thereby it is no longer necessary to subclass IoBase or a derivative to override _initialRead to use another thread.
    Added IoThread.setWaitableTimer and IoThread.getCompletionRoutine, also ensuring that the function pointers are available when the background thread tries to call them. The function wrapper keeps a weak reference to the method it wraps. Thereby it ensures that a method of a died instance is no longer executed.
    IoThread.queueAsApc still stores a strong reference to the wrapped method on its APC, to keep backwards compatibility. This will be changed to weak references starting in NVDA 2024.1. API deprecation logic is in place.
    Removed the pre_IoThreadStop extension point. It was added in 2023.1 but never implemented and announced, so I think it is safe to do so.

    Made portable creation through the installer or tools menu more flexible, by allowing system variables in paths (#14681)
    
    Fixes #14680
    
    Summary of the issue:
    While it is possible to use system variables (%appdata%, %userprofile%, %temp%, etc.) in the create portable dialog's "browse" sub-dialog, it was not possible to use them in the Create Portable dialog itself. Therefore, when using the installer or the tools menu portable option, one either had to enter full paths, or use the browse dialog to utilize system variables to minimize typing.
    For people who create many portables, that can be unnecessary overhead.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    It is now possible to use system variables (such as %tmp% or %homepath%) in the path specification while creating portable copies of NVDA.
    Additionally, it is no longer necessary to include a drive letter when entering the absolute path to a portable target.
    
    Description of development approach
    In gui.installerGUI, there is a method of PortableCreaterDialog class, called onCreatePortable: The path, as entered in the dialog (self.portableDirectoryEdit.Value), was used in this method three times.
    
    Created a local variable, expandedPortableDirectory, containing that value, processed through os.path.expandvars().
    Used that local value throughout the remainder of the method.
    Added a note to the error which appears if the user doesn't specify an absolute path, stating that system variables may be used.
    Rephrased the messages asking for the path, and removed the mention of the required drive letter, per NV Access review comments.
    Replaced a % substitution with a .format() string formatter, in an error dialog.
    Edited, reformatted, and added missing translator comments.
    Miscellaneous linting.
    Additional:
    In gui.installerGUI.doCreatePortable(): Linting, spelling, added translation comments, replaced substitutions with calls to format
    A note regarding no longer checking for drive letter in entered absolute path:
    While creating a portable copy, we ask the user for an absolute path. In the os.path module's opinion, a path can be absolute without having a drive letter. Therefore, we previously checked and threw an error if the drive letter was missing.
    When @seanbudd suggested removing the drive letter notation from absolute path messages, testing without entering one revealed errors that occurred if there was no drive letter, even though it shouldn't technically matter.
    
    Instead, since os.path.isabs has already determined that the path is absolute, we can just add the drive letter if it's missing.
    We can do that by calling os.path.abspath, which absolutizes the (probably mostly) already absolute path, by adding a drive letter if it was missing, and any other path components necessary to have a fully qualified path.

    Since technically a path can be absolute without having a drive letter, we previously checked and threw an error
    if the drive letter was missing, even though Windows doesn't require one to be absolute about the path.

    add the drive letter if it's missing.
    We can do that by calling os.path.abspath, which absolutizes the (probably mostly) already absolute path,
    by adding a drive letter if it was missing, and any other path components necessary to have a pedantically correct path.

    IA2TextTextInfo: Fix handling of embedded objects when expanding to mouse chunk. (#14755)
    
    Fixes #9235.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In Firefox, when there is text before and after a link, mousing over the text after the link often doesn't read the text. This applies to other types of inline elements as well; e.g. buttons.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    In Mozilla Firefox, moving the mouse over text after a link, etc. now reliably reports the text.
    
    Description of development approach
    When handling unit_mouseChunk, the code in IA2TextTextInfo.expand first expands to the user configured resolution (line, paragraph, etc.). It then attempts to shrink the range so that it only covers the text between embedded objects before and after the origin, if any.
    
    The code previously calculated the final end offset incorrectly. It used oldEnd - self._startOffset as the offset from which to search for an embedded object after the origin. However, self._startOffset had already been moved to the embedded object before the origin, so it was no longer related to the text string. This meant that the search offset was completely bogus and could even result in _endOffset being smaller than _startOffset.
    
    Now, we use the same offset for both embedded object searches: our origin relative to the start of the expanded range of text. I've also added comments.

    When reporting URL of a link use caret position instead of navigator object (#14723)
    
    Closes #14659
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #14583 @XLTechie added a global commands which allows to report a URL for the link at the position of the navigator object. While this is a huge improvement compared to either having copy the URL to the clipboard or accessing the URL from the status bar from the web browser, the fact that these scripts report destination for the link at the navigator object rather than focus / caret position makes their usage impractical for people who prefer to work with review cursor / navigator object not following focus / caret.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When user requests URL of a link NVDA reports URL of a link at the position of the caret / focus.
    
    Description of development approach
    Script for reporting URL was modified so that it first tries to get an object at the current caret position, and if that fails from the focused object. User guide and documentation for global commands were updated accordingly.
    After @XLTechie's review it was noticed that the script fails to work for links without href attribute, as part of this PR I've added handling for such links.

    Windows 10/11 Calculator: use UIA find descendants when fetching results while handling UIA notification event (#14745)
    
    Closes #14679
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Portable NVDA does not announce results when Windows 10/11 Calculator is in compact overlay mode.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Portable copy of NVDA will announce calculator expressions and results when Windows Calculator is in compact overlay mode (Alt+up arrow from standard calculator mode).
    
    Description of development approach
    Instead of using tree traversal, use UIA find descendants approach (employed in File Explorer) to obtain results element when Calculator is in normal and compact overlay mode. This also removes the need to check Calculator version as Windows 11 Calculator has made its way to Windows 10.
    
    Commits:
    
    * appModules/calculator: update copyright year. Re #14679
    
    * Calculator/UIA notification: fetch results via UIA descendants. Re #14679.
    
    If a portable copy of NVDA is running and compact overlay mode is active from Calculator, NVDA will not announce results as users type expressions, caused by index error stemming from tree traversal failure. As an alternative, use UIA descendants to locate results element, allowing portable NVDA to announce results when Calculator is in compact overlay mde. The find descendants code ultimately comes from the one employed in File Explorer when fetching status bar items.
    
    * Calculator: remove app version variable as it is no longer used when fetching results element. Re #14679.
    
    NVDA had to descend one more level when fetching results in Windows 11 Calculator. Now that the moer modern Calculator is available on Windows 10 along with use of UIA descendants to fetch results element, there is no need to check app version.

    Windows 11 Notepad: take 2 on announcing status bar contents in newer app releases via UIA decendants (#14622)
    
    Closes #14573
    Take 2 on #14573
    Resolves a flaw discovered in #14574
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #14574 and earlier, NVDA relied on child index when retrieving Windows 11 Notepad status bar contents. This is flawed: there are times when UI tree in Notepad can change if something opens and then closes. Specifically, when Notepad settings window (Alt+S) is opened and then closed, NVDA will announce something else when retrieving status bar contents.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will announce status bar contents in newer Windows 11 Notepad releases (same as #14574).
    
    Description of development approach
    Use UIA's FindFirstBuildCache to retrieve status bar contents (Automation Id: ContentTextBlock). As long as the Automation Id stays the same, the descendants approach will work across Notepad 11 releases.
    
    ---
    commits:
    
    * appModules/notepad: use UIA descendants instead of child index when fetching status bar. Re #14573.
    
    #14574 rework: Notepad 11.2301 introduces tabbed Notepad where multiple documents can be opened at once. This changes the Notepad UI tree so the old status bar chlid index no longer works. In the now reverted #14574 pull request, a different status bar index was used, but it had a critical flaw: when Notepad settings (Alt+S) opens and then closes, status bar command will say something, caused by UI tree changing once again. A more robust solution is using UIA descendants to look for a specific element, and provided that the Automation Id for the first status bar text stays the same (ContentTextBlock), the descendants approach will work. This is the same approach used in File Explorer app module to obtain status bar contents in File Explorer.
    
    * appModules/notepad: restore copyright header and type hints. Re #14573
    
    * appModules/notepad: uiItemWindow -> notepadWindow
    
    * appModules/notepad: status bar/UIA descendatns now resembles File Explorer app module more closely. Re #14573.
    
    Inspired by status bar getter in File Explorer app module: because Notepad foreground window is not a UIA element, tell UIA handler to obtain UIA element from foreground window handle. Apart from this and checking for AutomationId, Notepad status bar getter resembles File Explorer app module.
    
    * appModules/notepad: catch value error if the status bar content UIA element is NULL.
    
    UIA element for status bar contents wil be NULL (0x0) if status bar is not showing, therefore catch value error that can result from it.
    
    * appModules/notepad: remove status bar location check.
    
    Since status bar UIA element is not defined if invisible, there is no need to check its location.
    
    * appModules/notepad: UIAHandler.handler.clientObject -> clientObject
    
    * update changes

    Allow exporting a gesture map without saving it (#14582)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    You can currently load a gesture map from a file or a dictionary, but you can only save it as a file, i.e. you can't go from gesture map to the flattened dictionary format.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    Split out the save function into another function called export. The save function uses the export function internally. This can also be used for unit testing the code as demonstrated. Furthermore, it is useful for braille display driver authors to develop a gesture map in the user gesture map, then export it from the python console to include it in their driver in the proper format.

    Improve typing and handling of updateCheck state (#14739)
    
    If the updateCheckState pickle is set to "None", the state fails to load correctly.
    This can cause a crash.
    It is uncertain as to the cause of the pickle being set to None, but it is assumed to do with exiting NVDA during initialization.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Should fix rare crash where updateCheck.pickle is written to with invalid state information (unknown cause).
    
    Description of development approach
    Add typing, handle the case where pickle.load loads None for the state.
    
    Testing strategy:
    Set %appdata%/nvda/updateCheckState.pickle to "N." which loads as "None"
    Test if NVDA crashes on start up

    Avoid unnecessary sleep when handling caret movement to improve responsiveness. (#14708)
    
    NVDA frequently takes 30 to 45 ms to respond to cursor movement (arrow keys, etc.) in a text box. This doesn't seem like much, but anything we can do to improve responsiveness here makes for a better experience for the user.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA responds faster when moving the cursor in edit controls.
    
    Description of development approach
    1. Don't sleep or yield in KeyboardInputGesture.send. We sleep for 10 ms, which is at the upper end of acceptable audio latency for "instantaneous". Furthermore, the Windows timer resolution is only accurate to about 15.6 ms most of the time.
    This sleep was apparently added to ensure NVDA's keyboard hook ignored the injected keys. In my testing, removing this didn't seem to have any negative impact. If this does turn out to be a problem, we could watch for the last injected key in the keyboard event hook and fire a Windows event when it arrives. This will be faster to wake than a 10-16 ms sleep.
    2. When waiting for caret movement, spin the first few tries rather than sleeping. Again, we might sleep longer than we need to and sometimes apps respond much faster than we previously allowed for. Spinning for a very short while improves responsiveness without excessive resource usage.
    3. The caret movement waiting code was also refactored a bit to better calculate the elapsed time. We were previously relying on multiplying the sleep amount, which was inaccurate because sleep is inaccurate. For example, if we retried 3 times with a 10 ms retry interval, we would report 30 ms elapsed. However, each 10 ms could have been up to 16 ms in reality, resulting an actual elapsed time of 48 ms. It also didn't account for the time it took to query the control. Now we use the system clock to measure the elapsed time.
    4. Increase the use events timeout from 10 ms to 60 ms. As noted in 3), we were previously multiplying the sleep amount, which meant our supposed elapsed time was actually less than what had truly elapsed. This just updates the timeout to reflect reality. Without this, backspacing occasionally failed in UIA Notepad and the search box in File Explorer.
    Note that this does alter some class variables in EditableText. However, these were private (underscore prefixed), so I don't think this should be considered API breaking.

    HID Braille Driver: add more mappings for arrow keys (#14713)
    
    The Standard HID Braille driver does not provide mappings to the arrow keys as expected.
    Currently the joystick can be used for arrow keys and enter, but not the dpad. Some Braille devices, such as the Orbit Reader, only have a dpad and no joystick.
    Also, currently space+dot1 and space+dot4 are mapped to nextLine and previousLine braille commands. Manufacturers would prefer that these gestures map to up and down arrow, so that they also work in lists and on the Desktop etc.
    Description of changes
    When using a Braille Display via the Standard HID braille driver, the dpad can be used to emulate the arrow keys and enter. Also space+dot1 and space+dot4 now map to up and down arrow respectively.

    In Hindi, NVDA will not read anymore punctuation symbols whatever the punctuation level (2nd attempt) (#14558)
    
    A first PR (#14459) had been merged to fix #14417. Unfortunately an issue was found (see #14473) so it has been reverted in #14477.
    
    This PR is a second attempt to fix #14417 without causing #14473. It will remain a draft until I can have more information on #14473 from @OzancanKaratas, as requested in #14473 (comment), or from anyone else able to reproduce.
    
    Link to issue number:
    Fixes #14417
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Preliminary note for review
    Keep in mind the following: in NVDA with CLDR enabled and with no custom user symbol defined, symbol level for symbol X is defined as follows:
    
    look at locale symbol file:
    If X is defined in this file and a symbol level is defined for X, then this level applies for X. Else, look at next file.
    look at locale CLDR file:
    If X is defined in this file and a symbol level is defined for X, then this level applies for X. Else, look at next file.
    look at English symbol file:
    If X is defined in this file and a symbol level is defined for X, then this level applies for X. Else, look at next file.
    look at English CLDR file:
    If X is defined in this file and a symbol level is defined for X, then this level applies for X. Else, use default symbol level (don't remember if it is None or All).
    Description of the issue
    Hindi has no symbol defined in its symbol file, only copyright header; seems that the file was prepared for translation but no actual symbol translation took place. But there is a Hindi CLDR file.
    
    Currently, CLDR files are generated with level "None" for all symbols.
    
    Usually, in locales with a CLDR file and a normal symbol files, less common characters that are only in CLDR are reported at level None, i.e. whatever the punctuation level setting of the user. But common punctuation symbols (dot, question marke, etc.) are added by translators in the locale symbol file what allows to have these symbols reported at a higher punctuation level.
    
    For Hindi (or any language with no current symbol translated), all the characters present in CLDR file are reported at "None" level and above (i.e. at any level), because the level is not redefined in the locale (Hindi) symbol file.
    
    In such situation, using the level of the locale CLDR (None) is not a good strategy. It would be better to take advantage of the levels defined for the symbols in the English symbol file.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    CLDR data will be available for languages which had no symbol file (am, et, kk, ne, th, ur) or empty symbol file (hi). For these languages, since there are no locale symbol file definition, the level defined in the English symbol file will be honoured.
    
    Description of development approach
    Update nvda-cldr repository to get the changes implemented in nvaccess/nvda-cldr#4.

    Baum braille driver: provide more mappings for common keyboard commands (#14714)
    
    The Baum braille driver does not provide mappings for several common keyboard commands like other Braille drivers do. Examples being windows+d, tab, shift+tab etc.
    
    Description of changes
    As requested by Orbit for the Baum braille driver, Add several Braille gestures mapped to common keyboard commands
    • shift+tab key | space+dot1+dot3 |
    • tab key | space+dot4+dot6 |
    • alt key | space+dot1+dot3+dot4 (space+m) |
    • escape key | space+dot1+dot5 (space+e) |
    • windows key | space+dot3+dot4 |
    • alt+tab key | space+dot2+dot3+dot4+dot5 (space+t) |
    • NVDA Menu | space+dot1+dot3+dot4+dot5 (space+n) |
    • windows+d key (minimize all applications) | space+dot1+dot4+dot5 (space+d) |
    • Say all | space+dot1+dot2+dot3+dot4+dot5+dot6 |

    Improve responsiveness of input and focus by pumping immediately instead of after a delay. (#14701)
    
    Currently, everything in NVDA, including responding to keyboard input and focus changes, goes through the core pump. The core pump is always run with a slight delay. Assuming nothing else is already queued, any input or focus change will not be processed for a minimum of 10 ms. In reality, it's potentially longer due to the system timer resolution and the fact that timers are low priority messages. We should be aiming for the fastest possible response to user input and focus changes.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will respond slightly faster to commands and focus changes.
    
    Description of development approach
    The core pump has been refactored. Rather than using NonReEntrantTimer, it now uses wx.Timer directly and guards re-entry itself for better control. There is a main thread method (request) which manages scheduling/executing the pump to make state management easier.
    requestPump has a new immediate argument which specifies whether the pump should happen as soon as possible or after the delay. Delayed pumps are still useful in most cases for rate limiting and filtering, so this defaults to False.
    queueHandler.queueFunction has an _immediate argument which is passed to requestPump. It is _ prefixed to mitigate conflicts with keyword arguments intended for queued functions.
    inputCore, scriptHandler, focus changes and live text output all request an immediate core pump.

    Add pronunciation of Mac Option key symbol "⌥" (#14682)
    
    NVDA doesn't announce the symbol that macs use to represent the mac "Option" key ("⌥") (see Mac keyboard shortcuts documentation).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Adds a symbol description for this symbol ("mac Option key" announced at "none" level and up, similar to the existing entry for "mac Command key" at the "none" level for symbol "⌘").
    
    Description of development approach
    Followed the "Defining Symbol Information" developer documentation, using the existing "mac Command key" entry and similar recent PR #14548 as examples
    
    Testing strategy:
    Didn't attempt to adjust any automated tests (assumed they were already present generally for symbol pronunciation). Manually verified reading by:
    
    runnvda.bat from this branch
    Browse to Mac keyboard shortcuts docs
    Read through the content under the "Mac keyboard shortcuts" H1, particularly the list item with content "Option (or Alt) ⌥"
    Verify that the symbol is read out as "mac Option key" as expected
    Change NVDA's "Settings > Speech > Punctuation/symbol level" to "none" and repeat above steps

    sayAll: no longer prematurely stop sayAll after turning a page. (#14711)
    
    Fixes #14390
    
    Summary of the issue:
    With the merging of pr #14070 which added sayall in tables, SayAll in Kindle for PC would fail to continue reading after turning the page.
    Technical:
    Some of the code in the nextLine method in sayAll was refacted into a nextLineImpl method.
    However, if nextLineImpl returned false, finish would be called and nextLIne would return. This would be correct for handling the case where there was no more text, or table cells, but not the case where the page has just been turned. In fact, text sayAll already called finish when there was no more text, so calling finish again was useless in the base case, but for page turns caused sayAll to abort prematurely after the page was turned.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA no longer fails to keep reading with sayAll after crossing a page boundary.
    
    Description of development approach
    In sayAll's nextLine method, removed the call to self.finish when nextLineImpl returns False, but ensured that table sayAll's nextLineImpl does call finish itself if there is no more table cells.
    In other words, the self.finish call has been moved into the specific nextLineImpl method where it is needed, rather than running more broadly.

    soffice: Report page-relative caret position when available (#14727)
    
    When reporting the review cursor location in LibreOffice Writer, the announced position was not particularly useful to determine where in the document/page the cursor is currently located.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Similar to how it is done for Microsoft Word, report the current cursor/caret location relative to the current page when that information is available for LibreOffice Writer.
    
    Description of development approach
    To retrieve the page-relative cursor/caret location, this introduces and makes use of a new SymphonyDocumentTextInfo class that retrieves the page-relative cursor position via accessible attributes from the document object.
    These attributes are added to LibreOffice in this corresponding LibreOffice change:
    https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/149051
    The values returned by LibreOffice Writer are in twips, so convert that to inches or centimetres, depending on whether or not imperial measurement units are expected.
    If the attributes are not available, fall back to the handling that was already used so far.

    Settings Ring: Lazily load available setting values the first time they're needed (#14704)
    
    A settings ring entry for a String setting caches its possible values when creating the StringSynthSetting object. This can be costly if it takes some time for the possible values to return, for example when they're coming from a remote system in my remote desktop add-on.
    
    Description of development approach
    Load and cache the available settings values the first time they're fetched. This shouldn't have any noticeable impact for most synths.that

    No longer install fake gettext and pgettext in unit tests before initializing languageHandler (#14722)
    
    When executing unit tests we're installing fake gettext and pgettext functions. In normal usage this is not happening (languageHandler is responsible for setting localization support).
    
    Description of development approach
    _ and pgettext are no longer installed in unit tests. It was also necessary to modify unit tests which verifies announcements of capital letters, in which we are using a fake translation. It was changed so that the translation restored after tests is the one created by languageHandler not the fake one as it was done previously.

commit d2d4bfce2d31de8fca3c6df16caf93350b26374d
Author: James Teh <jamie@jantrid.net>
Date:   Thu Mar 9 10:21:32 2023 +1000

    Report aria-haspopup dialog/grid/list/tree in Firefox and Chrome. (#14709)
    
    NVDA reports "sub menu" for all values of aria-haspopup, which is misleading at best.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, NVDA now reports when a control opens a dialog, grid, list or tree if the author has specified this using aria-haspopup.
    
    Description of development approach
    1. Created new states for HASPOPUP_DIALOG, GRID, LIST and TREE. The general HASPOPUP state is still used for menus.
    2. Mapped the ARIA string values to states.
    3. Modified both the IA2Web NVDAObject and the Gecko_ia2 vbuf to expose these new states based on the haspopup object attribute.

    Removed redundant \xfe\xfd (#14705)
    
    Follow-up of #13045
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Driver sent to Albatross display byte string b"\xfe\xfd\xfe\xfd" to tell device that there is active connection and it should not send init packets anymore. Byte string contained two establishment packets, and one should be enough. It should not cause harm to send two packets because display ignores latter one but it is redundant anyway.
    
    In stead of b"\xfe\xfd\xfe\xfd" driver sends now b"\xfe\xfd" to display.

    Fixed a string that was not translatable. (#14691)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The string "has %s" is not translatable whereas it should.
    
    This is due to the fact that the formatting has been included in the gettext (underscore function)'s argument.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    For translators: the translation of the string "has %s" should now be working.
    
    Description of development approach
    First call gettext _ (underscore) function, and then format the result.

    Don't install gettext and pgettext before initializing languageHandler (#14677)
    
    Related to #14660
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When starting NVDA installs a 'fake' gettext and pgettext functions which translates to the language set as the current Windows locale. Later in the startup process languageHandler overwrites these installed translation functions with a new one which translate strings to the language chosen by the user (either in the configuration or from the CLI). Unfortunately if there is a module with translatable strings at its top level and it is imported before languageHandler is initialized these strings are either translated to the default system language, or for locales for which Python's locale.getdefaultlocale fails they remain in English. Similar problems were reported in #7770 and in #14657. Both of these are fixed, but the main problem is that bugs like this are difficult to identify before the release, since most contributors either use both NVDA and Windows in English, or at least their NVDA is in the same language as their operating system.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    This should not have any user visible impact.
    
    Description of development approach
    When starting NVDA or nvda_slave gettext and pgettext are no longer installed before initializing languageHandler.

    Register IA2 COM proxy on all Ui threads instead of only the main thread (#13542)
    
    Fixes #8553
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When an app offers IAccessible2 as its accessibility interface, NVDA needs to install a COM proxy in the UI thread to utilize IA2. However, some apps, particular those that embed Chromium Embedded Controls, have a separate UI thread for the browser control. IAccessible2 and therefore browse mode doesn't work in these controls.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    Register IA COM Proxy in all threads that ever send focus or foreground win events
    
    Testing strategy:
    Tested with the Chromium Embedded Framework test case from #13493 (comment)

    ia2LiveRegions: Ignore changes in editable text (#14666)
    
    Fixes Issue #8442.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Authors sometimes misguidedly mark editable text as a live region. This results in typed characters being echoed even if the user has speak typed characters turned off.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    In Firefox and Chrome (and derivatives thereof), Characters will no longer be echoed while typing in an editable text that is incorrectly marked as a live region.
    
    Description of development approach
    1. Use COM smart pointers in winEventProcHook to improve readability and maintainability. It's probably worth merging this as a rebase or full merge so this is separated from the second change.
    2. If an object has IA2_STATE_EDITABLE, ignore live region updates.

    Make Albatros again the last driver in detection order (#14686)
    
    As part of Pull request #14531, I ordered display order in bdDetect alphabetically. However, it seems that querying Albatross first has a major negative impact on detecting other displays using the same Serial to USB converter (see Pull request #13045)
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Handy Tech displays such as the Modular Evolution instantly auto detect again.
    
    Description of development approach
    Restored the order, Albatross is last in the dictionary again. I'm pretty unhappy with how these displays work, but it looks like it's a design thing in the displays itself.

    Gecko vbuf: Don't render anything if the document is dead. (#14647)
    
    This is intended to deal with the NVDA buffer infinite loop issue tracked in Mozilla bug 1786676, but it may also address NVDA vbuf crashes tracked in Mozilla bug 1691928 and Mozilla bug 1737688 (also tracked here as Issue #13540).
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA kills buffers for dead documents when a focus event is received. However, sometimes, when the user closes a tab, the closed document might die after the focus event for the newly active tab. Also, the focus event can be delayed sometimes; e.g. if loading a new document takes a while. When this happens, the buffer is still alive and listening for events, but the ids of nodes in that buffer might be reused by other documents! Trying to render those (completely arbitrary) nodes could cause a broken buffer tree (e.g. with loops), leading to instability later.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Hopefully fixes occasional crashes and complete hangs in Firefox.
    
    Description of development approach
    Hold a COM reference to the document. When an event is received which ostensibly matches a node in the buffer, check if the document is alive. If it isn't, skip the node and clear the buffer.
    To avoid excessive COM calls, only check this once per buffer update tick.
    Another fix could be to have Firefox fire EVENT_OBJECT_DESTROY when a document dies. NVDA's vbuf could then catch that and clear the buffer. While I'm happy to look at implementing this in both Firefox and NVDA in future, this is currently rather tricky to do in Firefox because some of the information we need to get the HWND for the event is already gone by the time we destroy the document. I can probably cache this somehow, but there are obscure edge cases, made more complicated by supporting both the old and new accessibility engine architectures at the moment. I think this approach is going to be more reliable in the short term, plus it will work with existing versions of Firefox.
