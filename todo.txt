*Need to generate a typelib for ISimpleDomNode in mozilla so NVDA can work out an IAccessible's mozilla MSAA child ID. Once this is done then work on the mozilla virtualBuffer can continue.
*Need to Add events in internet explorer that can update parts of the page due to things such as javascript.
*Need to be able to detect when a frame in internet explorer is fully loaded so we can re-load the virtualBuffer.
*Need to make MSHTML editable panes accessible (e.g. outlook express edit message window)
*Need to create mor NVDA config dialogs that can configure such things as document formatting and presentation.
*Need to make windows security dialogs (including windows log on) readable
*Need to work out a way of getting the label from a menu item when MSAA fails to do so (example: open with menu in windows explorer context menu).
