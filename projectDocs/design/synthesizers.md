# Synthesizers

## SAPI 4

SAPI 4 synthesizers are not included with NVDA, and the runtimes are no longer included with Windows.
Despite this, SAPI 4 support is still required, as many users prefer older synthesizers which rely on the SAPI 4 API.

To test SAPI 4, you must install the SAPI 4 runtimes from Microsoft, as well as a synthesizer.
Microsoft no longer hosts downloads for these, but archives and mirrors exist.

1. Download and install the SAPI 4 runtimes from [this Microsoft archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150910165037/http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/sapi/spchapi.exe).
1. Download and install a SAPI 4 synthesizer from [this Microsoft archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150910005021if_/http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/agent2/tv_enua.exe)

After this, you should be able to select SAPI 4 as a NVDA synthesizer.
