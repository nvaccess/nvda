## Reporting issues or feature requests

Issues can be [reported via GitHub](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/new/choose).
Please read the [issue template guide](./githubIssueTemplateExplanationAndExamples.md) for help filling out the appropriate template.
For advanced reporters, consider reading our [issue triage guide](./triage.md) to ensure the issue can easily be worked on.
If you don't have a clear idea of the issue, and you are unable to fill out the template, open a [GitHub discussion instead](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/discussions).

Do not report security issues via GitHub, instead follow our [security policy](../../security.md).

Issues with translations should be reported to the [NVDA Translators list](https://groups.io/g/nvda-translations).

If you are reporting an issue with an application or website, please consider reporting the issue to the authors of the application/website first.

If you are a developer reporting an issue with your application/website, please include a minimal reproducible sample and details of the specification not being handled correctly.
