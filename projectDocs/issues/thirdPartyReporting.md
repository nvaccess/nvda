# Third Party Issue Reporting Resources

When NVDA users encounter issues that are caused by third-party software, it is often most effective to report these problems directly to the maintainers of the affected software.
Below is a list of common third-party products and frameworks, along with links to their official issue trackers or support channels.

Note: When reporting issues, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

* Steps to reproduce the issue
* NVDA version and configuration
* Operating system and version
* Application or website version
* Any relevant logs or error messages

Once you have opened an issue on the other project, if a related NVDA issue exists, share a link to the third-party issue you created on the NVDA issue so we can keep track of it.

For NVDA-specific triage, see our [issue triage documentation](./README.md).
