# Creating new issues on the NVDA project

This page is meant to serve as an explanation for how to fill out our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nvaccess/addon-datastore/issues/new/choose).

The template uses GitHub markdown, to provide formatting for headings, lists, quotes etc.
If you are not familiar, please take some time to learn about 
[Github markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

**Warning**: In all but exceptional circumstances we require this template to be completed.
Your issue will likely be closed if this template has not been followed.

We currently have two templates, both are described on this page:
- for bug reports
- for feature requests.

## General information
The following information applies to all issues (bug reports, new features, even pull requests).

### Attachments / Images

It's important to include any files that are required to reproduce an issue.
This might be a required file for an office suite, or a link to a code playground such as CodePen or JSFiddle, or perhaps a standalone HTML file.
Github does not allow all [file types to be attached](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), however, zip files are allowed, so you can always zip your file and attach that instead.

#### Logs
In most cases an NVDA log file is incredibly helpful when trying to understand/fix an issue, please remember to attach one.
More [instructions are available on the wiki](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/LogFilesAndCrashDumps).
If you are getting a crash dump file (nvda_crash.dmp) please also include it.

#### Screenshots
While we welcome **images/screenshots** to help explain a problem, be aware that many of the developers of NVDA are blind and will greatly appreciate this image being described in text.
Most tools allow you to copy text out of them.

### Help
If you have trouble following this template, or with the initial investigation that is required, please politely ask for assistance from the fantastic community of people on the [NVDA users mailing list](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/Connect#international-users-mailing-list-english)
